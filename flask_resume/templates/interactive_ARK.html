You may say wtf are you on about I want to fight other people !?  Well  hate to break it to you but you PVP and  your going to get recked plain and simple.  \n\nAll of us who enjoy building taming dinos and crafting for fun are on PVE severs.   \n\nBut anyway on to the actual review.   \n\nPERFORMANCE:\n\n The performance at times is terrible but its early access , you cannot expect a smooth perfect product , if you are upset by this then best you wait till full release and stop complaining the performance is less than desired, YOU SIGNED UP TO AN EARLY ACCESS PRODUCT.   There are moments when game will freeze for a few seconeds. The server restarts can be bloody annoying , there numerous roll backs aswell. \n\nGAMEPLAY: \n\nGame play wise you have your standard mincrafty style mining gathering resources etc you level up but simply existing , gathering resources,  taming dinos , killing wild dinos , and crafting.  each time you level up you will gain \"Engram\" points which can be spent to gain skills and expand your building menu.   \n\nYou upgrade items by unlocking the previous engram first for example   Campfire -> Cooking Pot ,    Slingshot -> Stone Bow.  \n\nIts not possible to learn all the engrams so you must choose carefully , if you bring friends you can each cover the ones you do not have.   \n\nTheres also a neat mechanic \"Drops\" before you shudder at this word thinking its some werid god like item that occurs rarely and gives everyone the best gear ,  WRONG , these are common and appear randomly all over the map and are limted to certian levels so each and every player no matter what level has a chance to get a drop.  They can include anything from clothing to building items , to even Blueprints.\n\nBLUEPRINTS :\n\nLike the word says it implies some sort of design, Blue prints are rare items that allow a player to create items that they don't have the engram for thus saving the use of your precious engram points.  aslong as its in inventory you can make the said item no matter what level you are provided you have the matierals. \n\nGRIEFING : \n\nA sad reality on PVP servers as many other reviews say is a shithole.  You will die and you will die alot anything you do , or build  will be destroyed and you will loose all your dinos simple.  At the current stage of development theres little anyone can really do to combat this save have a boat load of dinos and living in a dangerous or  remote part of the island. if you truely want to play the game with others and enjoy they game go PVE  you will enjoy it as much as I have and with alot less frustration. \n\n", "upvoted": true, "time_of_review_unix": 1435536240.0, "minutes_played": 68216, "upvotes_window": 2029, "total_window": 2759, "percent_window": 0.7354113809351214, "neu_sent": 0.688, "neg_sent": 0.141, "pos_sent": 0.171, "comp_sent": 0.9325, "neu_window": 0.7022630434782611, "neg_window": 0.09218115942028983, "pos_window": 0.20374275362318825, "comp_window": 0.33347641304347775, "percent_window_roc": 0.8670807453416148, "neu_window_roc": 0.7970279195436806, "neg_window_roc": 0.6604425465838509, "pos_window_roc": 0.5406564630457357, "comp_window_roc": 0.5913742690058479, "1day_forecast": 0.002203297963961237, "1day_delta": 0.0018246497671877693, "classification": 0.0, "neg_predict": 0.008380539279111079, "pos_predict": 8.113432836491202e-05}, {"time_of_review": "2015-06-30T00:10:04", "review": "Since most people are bashing the PvP servers for the griefing, I feel like someone should answer that and also talk a bit about the PvE servers.\n\nRight now I got close to 130 hours in the game, about half of that on PvP servers and half of that on PvE, all official ones. All the thing people say about the griefers is true, they'll kill your dinos, steal your stuff, abuse your body and destroy your house as soon as you go to sleep. In fact a lot of tribes organize group to play past midnight for the sole reason of hunting sleeping players. And that's the keyword here TRIBES. If you're playing on a PvP server you gotta keep in mind that you're not supposed to do it at your pace and take your time building your little Tatch hut with it's little thatch fence with your Raptor and a couple of Dilos. Slowly learning the game by yourself, taking everything in, eventually upgrading to Wood and then Stone and so forth.\n\nI'm sorry but I got to burst your bubble right now: If you plan on playing in a PvP server you gotta take this game seriously. You either find a group of friends to play with you or you join a Tribe as soon as possible. If you play alone you might find a hidden spot where your stuf will be safe one or two nights, maybe even a week, but alone you're doomed to be found, robbed and killed. And like many others said, have the work of a whole week go down the drain. If you're joining a PvP server you're doing it for Tribe warfare and let me assure you, thing can get really intense, really epic pretty fast. With eagles swooping down to grab enemies and droping them from high altitues to their deaths, or tactical droping Raptors inside their base to wreak havok, T-Rexes working as battering rams at the enemies gates while rockets fly at them, auto-turrets spewing bullets at your Carno army, Sabretooths leaping over walls. It is a beauty to behold.\n\nBut you'll only experience that if you join one of the dominating tribes on your server or work on creating a strong Tribe of your own. Otherwise you'll just be cattle for them, nothing else. They'll keep you from taming dinos by killing them mid proccess, block caverns so only they can harvest the resources, literally kidnap you to use you as a blood bag Mad Max style and so on.\n\nI get why so much people hate that, after all they're just being preayed upon, they're not participating in all the fun that is Tribe Wars. But the only way to Tribe Wars be so much fun is allowing all this kind of freedom the game has right now, they gotta allow people to be complete a-holes because during wars that's what you gotta be. If they put too many safety nets to keep people who wanna do PvP only when THEY wanna do PvP the game would be boring and stale.\n\nBut if everything I said right now put you off, don't be. First of all because you don't really need PvP for this game to be fun. There's a TON of stuff to do in PvE servers or offline if you just wanna do everything at your pace. I got a bit tired of all the pressure on PvP servers and have been playing in a PvE for around 60 hours right now. And I still only got only a Wood base with some Dinos, just hit level 45, and I feel like I'll never run out of things to do because the devs just keep adding and adding stuff almost each day. People are also very helpful on PvE servers, they'll give you a hand when you have problems with a Rex, help you gather Prime meat when you're taming a Carnivore, give you tips and materials. At least on my server I got absolutely nothing to complain about them.\n\nAnd if you're still one of the guys who wanna grow at your pace and only participate on PvP when you're ready, REJOICE! Because they'll soon add War Declaration to PvE servers, so tribes can actually go at war when they feel like it, without all the griefing to new players who want just to keep to themselves.\n\nAs a closing statement, I'd like to congratulate the Devs. They're doing a terrific job. Optimization is alreayd a LOT better, still not there yet, but much better. The content is fantastic and it just keeps coming. Bugs are rarer and rarer, in fact I don't even remember the last time I experienced one.\n\nAn all around great game that I fully recommend if you're into dinossaurs and survival games.

PvE is player vs enviorment..shouldnt complete assholes be banned or are yous gonna let this be a usual thing in Ark?\n    Crack down on the crappy teenage pranksters and this could be bigger than most games\nHonestly after being robbed 3 times i feel like I should kick this game to the bin, but theres something very appealing about it..appart from no admins doin anything about ganking or robbing/hacking\n           I would still recommend it to all my friends\nps..easy fixes..if a player is on a pve base they could exit any door but not enter..sort the locks out pronto or this game will be binned\n    \n", "upvoted": true, "time_of_review_unix": 1435795412.0, "minutes_played": 13716, "upvotes_window": 1967, "total_window": 2636, "percent_window": 0.746206373292868, "neu_sent": 0.765, "neg_sent": 0.106, "pos_sent": 0.129, "comp_sent": 0.6245, "neu_window": 0.7019708001516883, "neg_window": 0.09091733029958293, "pos_window": 0.20521350018960932, "comp_window": 0.3510881683731506, "percent_window_roc": 0.8602849558480958, "neu_window_roc": 0.9277273386023233, "neg_window_roc": 0.7687713310580204, "pos_window_roc": 0.6332127157619167, "comp_window_roc": 0.688581522064547, "1day_forecast": -0.005916959736127714, "1day_delta": -0.0001677434791662602, "classification": 0.0, "neg_predict": 0.0135312588296909, "pos_predict": 0.00026154985926612464}, {"time_of_review": "2015-07-03T00:01:42", "review": "My friends told me that pooping was a function a tad bit too late.\n\n10/10 would poop my pants again.", "upvoted": true, "time_of_review_unix": 1435881702.0, "minutes_played": 5242, "upvotes_window": 1944, "total_window": 2625, "percent_window": 0.7405714285714285, "neu_sent": 0.846, "neg_sent": 0.0, "pos_sent": 0.154, "comp_sent": 0.4767, "neu_window": 0.7041317593297786, "neg_window": 0.0911854531607007, "pos_window": 0.20277913175932957, "comp_window": 0.3455593297791318, "percent_window_roc": 0.8573604613208573, "neu_window_roc": 0.9270935199193892, "neg_window_roc": 0.7687479599608312, "pos_window_roc": 0.6346788525006347, "comp_window_roc": 0.6899293168183215, "1day_forecast": -0.002061127462078316, "1day_delta": -0.005634944721439439, "classification": 0.0, "neg_predict": 0.014830459471647099, "pos_predict": 0.0002494578700474483}, {"time_of_review": "2015-07-04T00:04:21", "review": "EA = Early Access people!\n\nAt first I had my doubts for this game due to it being EA for it.

First off, the deciding factor in me even risking 30 dollars on this game was seeing how active the developers are and how often the game is updated. After losing money on projects like DayZ standalone and other similar games this is a very important factor in predicting the future success of a game. \n\nOnto gameplay. I absolutely love everything about this game, for it being in development but still have polished features as it does is nothing short of amazing. Of course there are bugs and FPS issues and things of that nature which are to be expected, but in comparison to other developers these guys have it down right. They are listening to the community and working hard on updates all the time. \n\nThere are a lot of things that can be improved upon and fixed of course but I feel its pointless to mention them or get angry at the developers when clearly if you are paying attention to their interviews and updates. They are very intelligent and patient. They seem to never make promises they can't keep and when seeing certain features and gameplay implementations they are adding its clear to me they have the right mindset in keeping a survival game balanced and fun for all types of different gamers.\n\nI will admit I have spent very little time on high populated PVP servers. This is for obvious reasons, people will give bad reviews to the game cause they get killed while sleeping or their fort gets smashed, but you joined a 60+ man server expecting to not get messed with? Its just stupid to give bad reviews simply because of your bad decision making. Some people like the excitement of full blown pvp and possibility of getting raided, so just because you can't handle it, doesn't mean others cant. I mostly have been sticking to PvEPvP servers where the population on the server rarely gets over 20 people. I have found in this enviorment you find friendlier people willing to work together and you also still have the excitement of PvP but more mature PvP. Like for example a level 60 player passed up killing me simply because I had a low level character, instead he gave me hide and metal tools to boost my experience. This is something you rarely would get on an official fully populated server. So dont cry and give bad reviews cause you cant hang with the big dogs. Its also a survival game, you will die and you will lose everything at some point. This is the way of survival games.\n\nI will finish this review by saying I have not been this addicted to a game since DayZ MOD, not standalone, cause standalone is garbage. But this game has resparked my interest in the open world survival genre. \n\nOh yea, forgot about the dinosaurs. THERE ARE BADASS DINOS!!! I legit spend a lot of time in game just watching the habits and fights on wild dinos around me. I expect the AI will be improved which will only make dino watching even cooler. There is no better feeling than taming your first dino and making him/her your own. There is no worse feeling than watching it die as a result of decisions you made.

Anyone who can regularly commit several hours a day will love this game, but it's just not at all friendly for casual gamers.  I'm willing to grind a bit for what I get, but I work a 9-5 job, so I can't regularly spend hours and hours on this game.  I need to be able to log in for an hour, make a little progress and log out.  While I understand that this is still a pre-release game, here's just a few ways that this game does not allow that:\n\n1) Food goes bad even while you are logged out.  So you can have 100 food in your inventory before bed, but it's all gone the next morning.\n\n2) Taming a dinosaur takes a VERY long time.

The prior has nothing to do with broken game mechanics as it is viciously obvious that this is a key component of the game even before buying it. With that being said, there are Unofficial server options, PvE servers, and simply the option of joining a larger tribe for protection. With all that in place, that doesn't merit a bad review. In regards to the map glitches complaint, these people may have missed the fact that this is an EARLY ACCESS game; I've been the victim of one or two of these unnecessary deaths / losses and while it does suck that's what we get for purchasing the game early. Not that it's even that big of a deal, they're only minor setbacks and the Devs have already done quite a bit to patch these things and I would assume they will continue.\n\nNow that my rant is out of the way I'd just like to say that this game is one of a kind and hardly compares to other open world simulators that I've tried, definitely a future in it.

I built a thatch house and then I built a bigger wood house which took alot of effort and I leveled up a few times while building it. I'd have to say that I've enjoyed running around and building stuff and surviving. The dinosaurs are glitchy as heck and as the lag that I mentioned before, it may just have to do with this computer being over 3 years old. Anyway. Very fun game.\n\n*another edit*\n\nHad to deal with a server reset where all my progress is gone. (Not a big deal) doesn't happen very often..The dinosaurs are more glitchy when you kill them they seem to float off into the air which is anoying when you want to h arvest their meat and or hides. I also built a wooden shack to log back in after sleeping that night to see my door torn down and all my stuff gone by someone that decided to run by my shack and take all my stuff. Getting raided is a thing. So find someone to team up with and try to build a good defensive barrier around your shack. Anyway I keep coming back and forth to my review to change it depending on if the game pisses me off or not. But my FPS has improved exponentially and it's alot of fun.\n\nI bought a new computer and the game runs alot better. It still has framerate issues and there's alot of \"things\" that need to be done to enable this to be a smooth and enjoyable experience. I had a bird on \"follow\" so that it would stay out of harms way and went to shoot a raptor with a shotgun and the bird flew infront of me and I killed the bird. \n\nWait until they optimize this

It takes the most successful components of survival games, crafting, collecting resources, eating, building shelter, and brings all these things to another level: Surviving on an island with Dinosaurs. Building a base is not as easy as you would think on an island with Dinosaurs, as the larger ones can easily destroy any dwelling created simply by walking on it. You have several types of materials to build structures with including; Thatch, Wood, Stone, and Metal. There are over 60 different types of dinosaurs so far in the game and the developers are always adding new content. Some Dinosaurs can be tamed and used as protection, pack mules, for egg or shit farming, resource collecting, or even to ride. \n\nYou can play Ark: Survival Evolved both as a single player game, as well as in multiplayer mode, either on public or privately hosted servers. You are not limited to first-person perspective as some survival games do, a third-person perspective is an option. You can also tailor various aspects of the game to your own personal playstyle, using the settings prior to launching the game in single player. Make the nights shorter and the days longer, adjust the regrowth rate of flora and fauna, there are dozens of options to choose from.\n\nArk: Survival Evolved initially made me wary, because of the concept of a survival game on an island with dinosaurs; However, once I played it I realized the amazing potential it had. Some Dinosaurs are passive, and of course many are hostile and predatory, but there is a great balance to the game and if you play it smart, you can survive a long time and have a lot of fun. The developers seem to really be interested in making this an amazing game, even going as far as to reward players who are able to find exploits. Visually speaking I think the game is on par with a lot of the more recent survival titles and the details of the dinosaurs are amazing. This game is good enough, if you enjoy survival games it is worth paying full price for.

PVP isn't exclusive to just PVP servers so sadly you can't just switch servers and be ok. The raiding is also consistently on every server so no matter where you switch its a problem that doesn't go away.  This makes the game rounds of getting raided or rading other people and honestly means that the only way to really play is single player unless you constantly like getting taunted and killed.\n\nwait . .  . what about tribes for defense?? oh no people have that locked too. large tribes on server constantly beat down smaller tribes. I guess that's great if you are dominant and love large groups but otherwise sucks. Also people now use tribes as a way to screw with people. They start on a new server, join a tribe looking for members, and then use their inner access to destroy everybody else's hard work. They then laugh, leave, and do whatever. What sucks about that is if you are adding people to try to defend against raids you may not be able to tell who it was that you added that caused the problem so it can happen several times before you  find out who it was and kick them.\n\nOh and this continues EVEN while logged off.

If you're used to games in which you create your character and immediately commence killing the living crap out of everything in your way, this game is going to grind you into the dirt. There are no shortcuts or easy routes to the top in Ark. You have to build up, get destroyed and learn from it time and time again before you reach a level of strength and experience in which you can handle the island and it's often naked inhabitants. You will most definitely spend hours taming a dino that will likely get murdered due to your inability to protect it at the time. You will be shot randomly by turrets. You will probably resolve yourself to wave goodbye to that new suit of armor you just farmed to build because a T Rex just won't let you get near your body to collect it. You will be raided when you are offline, griefed by invisible unknown assailants that you will likely never find nor take revenge upon and you should probably prepare to be unexpectedly death dropped from a thousand feet by someone's war spec'd Argentavis while minding your own business. This game does not hold your hand, there are no tutorials and trolls are quite common amongst the player base but not so prevailent that it makes the game itself awful to play. In short, it's an uphill battle that will probably tax most of you to the brink of insanity and fits of rage quitting. Why play at all then? A base bristling with spino sails, the toothy grins of t-rexes and a flat out stupid amount of auto turrets is it's own reward. 10/10", "upvoted": true, "time_of_review_unix": 1441238477.0, "minutes_played": 163935, "upvotes_window": 1526, "total_window": 2268, "percent_window": 0.6728395061728395, "neu_sent": 0.771, "neg_sent": 0.133, "pos_sent": 0.097, "comp_sent": -0.944, "neu_window": 0.6705019832525345, "neg_window": 0.0996787130894666, "pos_window": 0.2271701189951522, "comp_window": 0.28754808285588396, "percent_window_roc": 0.7968267959453504, "neu_window_roc": 0.8945213169712408, "neg_window_roc": 0.7845888686016496, "pos_window_roc": 0.7015867393241427, "comp_window_roc": 0.6135325091044049, "1day_forecast": 0.0037730431909165363, "1day_delta": 0.0038035221657315432, "classification": 0.0, "neg_predict": 0.046358815441280114, "pos_predict": 0.013703506440835612}, {"time_of_review": "2015-09-04T00:00:40", "review": "Awesome game, has a lot of content for only being in alpha.

Reason why is because i wanted to try it out before spending 30 bucks to do so. Honestly it is a really intresting game. \nGraphics- If you dont have a great Video Processor, i would say upgrade before u buy. Beautiful game really. Everything looks amazing....if your computer can run it. I have a Core Radeon R7  265 925M Boost 2Gb D5 video card and a 1080 core processer and i could only play it on medium if i was lucky to get 29 FPS. Mine is a medium to high quiality grahics and processer and it had trouble, but thats my configureation so u decide if u have the nessacry requirements for the game\nGameplay- Really fun and different. Depeneding on the settings before you start the game, you will either have to find the rares or just go to a bush to get what u need. Gathering (my experience) is easy and fun. Dont need to really go far to get them unless it is the rarer stuff that you have to adventure to. The leveling system i thought i wouldnt like but in reality i did . Simple and lots of stuff to upgrade. Like an MMO or RPG. Tamming animals is a bit of an issue. Even with the settings on lowest time it takes, it still takes a butt ton of time to tame. My brother was taming a Trike for 3 hours and all the sudden a Alpha Raptor came out of no where and killed him and the trike. SOOOO yea there is that. Also near the inner part of the island there are the big guys and they dont take a lot to kill but in m ecperience there are more than 1.\nOverall- Visually stunning, even on medium graphics, lots to do even if u have nothing to do. Game play is simple enough to understand and not to hard to learn. Overall the only issue if have with the game is the optimization. There really isnt anything that really helped me out in terms of how choppy the game was for me and my brother ( and we have 2500 dollar rigs) so idk about that.

I have been looking for a great sandbox game with the role playing aspects as well as the ability to survive.  The dinosaurs are an added bonus.  The art work is amazing and the game isn't even in full release.  Every time I explore, I see something different, or can see how the growth has begun to grow back on an area we haven't been in lately.  I see over time changes in the art and it's amazing.  I continue to say, I hope they do this....I hope they do that...and then soon, I see the patches and they are added.  They work so hard and fast in this game and the talent behind it blows my mind.  The choices of how to play the game vary greatly for any player who plays.  I would say think of SIMS, ZOO TYCOON, WoW or RIFT, and TUROK had a baby.  That is ARK.

I would not be able to though as I am attacked very quickly by everything that wants to eat me within one night. On top of that the creature that killed me sits on top of my inventory so progression halts and I am constantly playing catch up for it to happen three or four more times. I am not sure if I was supposed to tame an army of dodos so I could take on the level 4 alpha raptor that keeps killing me or the level 9 carno that kills me or the giant scorpion that kills me because I just got tired of being killed and then not being able to retrieve my supplies without dying. I intend to write an email to the developers to tell them of the disatisfaction I feel over being duped into buying an awesome looking game with seemingly no way of playing if I cannot get past the second night without doing things one specific way. I do not like games that seem sandbox like or open and really the only way to play falls into a few if not one method. That to me seems like a lie.\n\nMultiplayer at first was fun but very soon degraded into people either killing you outright or having the same issues I had in single player. \n\nI know this game falls under early access so I will play agian possibly after I cool down or when they have posted an update that makes the game not easier but possibly less brutal in the way that you cannot succeed without wasting time. I understand I am playing a video game(or am I the one being played hmm..) and I am wasting my time but I would hope the developers would have a notion of entertainment rather than frustration. Darkest dungeon can be frustrating but they give you the hope of survival and conquest while this game just shits all over you because of what seems to me to be poor understanding of the player

Please note that these specs are listed so you have a metric by which to judge the graphical compatibility of my review to your system.\nSpecs: \n* Windows 64bit OS\n* 8GB Ram\n* Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-6500U Dual Core Processor\n* NVIDIA GeForce 940M 2GB Discrete Graphics\n* Razer Naga (This is important if only due to the way hotkeys in the game are set up at base)\n\nPART ONE: GAMEPLAY OVERVIEW\n\nAppearance:\nOverall the game is actually quite beautiful. To optimize FPS I currently play with graphics on a medium setting. Overall the game looks lovely. The dinosaurs are well textured and animated, the physics of the game are realistic in a way that is actually gratifyig (for example, if a sauropod walks near you or your home the ground will rumble and the screen will shake). The world is interesting and coherantly built as a tropical paradise with a surprising and almost pleasing attention to detail within the world (the dense undergrowth in the jungle, for example). I did have some small difficulty with the light dispersal in the trees while in the forest. At times, it's well lit, and other times (within the same area and around the same time of day) it is almost impossible to see two feet in front of you without a torch. In terms of character appearance, there is actually a surprising and gratifying amount of customization. \n\nControls:\nThe Controls in ARK are pretty intuitive for your average survival game. You have numbered hot keys that can be activated to select new weapons or items. These controls can also be changed, as can the items assigned to them (one through settings menu, one through inventory) I personally enjoy playing this game with my Naga, however. It makes switching between weapons and tools a breeze for the surprise dinosaur or insect swarm especially early game.\n\nDifficulty:\nARK has different difficulty settings that you can apply when creating a solo world. Server difficulty will depend based on the server settings. You can play with the sliders when you start to host your own game, which I reccomend that you do when learning. Ark can be challenging. Especially to a new player. Like Rust, it relies on survival and a good head for direction, especially early game. You are likely going to die a few times as you get comfortable and learn more crafting formulas. PVP as a new player is diffficult if you don't have at least a base of knowledge, but once you do get your level up and start to learn more about it, it can be immensely rewarding. Similarly to minecraft, if you die and drop your items you can run and retrieve them for a short period of time, but try to keep backups anyways. It will help ease the early game grind.\n\n\nContent/Gameplay:\nThe gameplay is similar to that of Rust. You spawn into your world with one mission. Survive. Unlike Rust, you do not get a rock. Everything much be punched and crafting recipes (engrams) need to be learned so that you can harvest more reliably. You also do damage to yourself while punching, so predators early game will pretty much just beat the shit out of you, especially if they catch you by surprise. Your best bet is to farm berries from bushes, and try to get your pickaxe and axe/hatchet engrams first. Second priority is the spear engram, and then the one that allows you to make armor, shelter, a fire and chests. With those completed, you have a base from which you can begin to explore. The beach is normally safe for new players. HOWEVER. The beach is only safe when it is along the ocean. I set up camp and followed the ocean only a little bit inland and got my tots rekt by a surprise spinosaur. The difficulty of monsters jumps immensely from beach to forest, and I don't reccommend you explore without at LEAST a few spears and some basic armor. There are also difficult to see insects, (flying and earthbound) in the forests that attack in swarms. This can be dangerous early and even mid game as in the forest, and especially at night they can be very difficult to see when not airborne. There are \"crates\" that are dropped in beams of light. Before running halfway across the map for onesuch crate I would strongly urge looking up the different level codes. Each beam of light has a color that denotaes the minimum level required to open it. It sucks to run halfway around the continent only to find out that you found a crate 30 levels higher than your character!\n\nAs if the environment isn't deadly enough, you're also fighting against yourself. Hunger. Thirst. Cold. Heat. Suffocation. Exhaustion. All can get you while you're out exploring. Learning how to stockpile food (which goes bad if enough time has elapsed) is very important. Similarly, if you are looking to progress the game you constantly need to be farming, and know what you're farming for. Limited by engrams, it's not always easy to learn what materials are good for you to hoard early game. However... when you hit midgame... it's worth it. Why, you ask? BECAUSE YOU CAN TAME DINOSAURS.\n\nAs for the rest of the game play, I won't release spoilers. I have only played 10 hours, after all. Needless to say there is a pretty cool world boss and some other interesting stuff you can do in terms of bio weaponry, etc. \n\nStaying Power:\nIf you like games like Rust, you will probably really enjoy this game. If you are just curious about the hype of ARK, however, I will warn that the early game grind can get very boring if you aren't ready for or accustomed to this style of play. My advice would be, if you don't like grinding for your own items, to join a friendly PVP or PVE server and let them help you out with items or EXP. This is a double edged sword, however, as most people who are capable of doing this are immensely high level and have surpassed your capabilities in terms of engram crafting and goals. This game, in my opinion is deffinately WAY more fun with friends, and a cooperative and team effort to build up a base and battle is fun. My personal prefference is PVE, rather than PVP, but anything is possible in ARK.\n\n\nTL;DR\n\nPros: \n- Graphically beautiful, a rich, well rendered environment.\n- Customizable character.\n- Controls are intuitive for the game genre.\n- Lots to explore\n- Long-term farming and base building. \n- YOU CAN TAME DINOSAURS!\n- Servers can help you avoid the early game grind and put you right in the action!\n\nCons: \n- Can be graphically demanding.\n- Light sources can be tricky. It is reccommended you keep a torch or some sort of handheld light source on you at all times.\n- Seems geared towards a curve in difficulty where early game is hardest and mid-late game gets easier the more you farm.\n- Early game being punishing means that it is a near constant farming grind for the first several hours of the game.\n- Joining a server can also result in a grind, or just boredom if you are much lower level than others in it.\n\nGames with similar themes:\nMinecraft (you punch the tree to get the wood, you use the wood to build the cabin). In all serious, they both require an immense amount of farming before you're ready for end game.\nRust: Similar survival game. \nPokemon: I didn't want to make the joke, because in terms of actual gameplay it is nothing like pokemon, but c'mon. I also am trying to catch them all. My PVP clan hates me.\n\nOverall rating:\n7/10\n\nWhile I really like gameplay elements the grind gets a little bit boring, and integrating into a server can be difficult when you have to farm XP religiously just to particpate in group activities.

I understand your frustration, but seriously, I'm getting tired (and pretty sure other people are, too.) of seeing your nagging comments.\n\nAnyways, this survival game is not like any other I've played.

I felt like I was safe and well protected for the journey.\n\nThat is, until I reached the mouth of the river near the south-east island.\n\nI was bombarded by raptors.\n\nThe journey that I thought was going to be great turned out to be a real fail. \nSo, I spawned back at the hut where I had built a bed, and tried getting some stuff back. I planned to take a different route, to avoid the raptors that killed me. \n\nNot a good idea either, as I had mistakenly gone down the swamp, and was then killed by massive snakes. \n\nI gave up, left the hut, and just spawned at North Zone 2.\n\n11/10, would die by raptors again.

I wasted phone data so i could get the 5mins I needed playing online in order to comment. Don't know why the Steam interface cant keep a simple clock running of offline hours played in any game.\n\nThat said I can say nothing about all the negative reviews for the multiplayer. Especially, since I am not really a competitive player. I much prefer co-op play. Apparently, online play is highly competitive and some of the recent patches have reduced the power of some Tribes even forcing some to start all over.\n\nI blew this game off for a while primarily because of the AR-15 wielding raptor rider main advertising image. But this game really is a terrific sandbox. Tons of crafting. Dino taming, which can take a long time so be prepared. Grow crops. Build thatch, wooden, and then stone structures (recipes build on each other). The dyeing options for clothing are pretty great as different parts of the same piece of clothing can be colored differently. Details like that in the game really add to the enjoyment and sense of discovery and accomplishment.\n\nWhile I love survival games I suck at them. I lost count of how many times I died within 15mins of spawning...until I built my first hut and worked from there. YMMV but you will probably die more than you're used to, which means losing all gear on your body, but not your built and stored items. Nor do you lose levels or recipes. So die, but you will progress. You can run back to your body to collect your gear, but that can be risky, what just ate you is probably still there and likely still hungry :)\n\nSome of this game is counterintuitive: I can pick up a rock, but cant use it to harvest small trees...instead you have to use your fists. This makes no sense.\n\nThe map is huge and gorgeous. This game is PC intensive. You will probly need to lower your settings. But it's still gorgeous even then. I haven't even begun to explore as I'm too busy harvesting and building a main settlement for myself. I am at Hidden Lake in the NE corner of the map, find the trail off the beach and get there, its a great soloer starting place.\n\nI am anxious to start farming. I am interested in dino breeding and would love to see crop breeding at some point. I want to explore on foot/dino more of the map and perhaps build hunting lodges spread across the island to respawn at. I want to build experimental housing in various terrains. I want to hunt, harvest, and explore.\n\nThis is a completely sandbox game, especially if you are solo playing. There is no content but what you choose to do next.\n\nI just hope the devs-company and the online players can resolve their differences. I would hate to see this game slow in progress or development because of the issues you can read in plenty of other comments.\n\nUntil then I am thoroughly enjoying myself.\n\nI am completely satisfied with my purchase.", "upvoted": true, "time_of_review_unix": 1454198583.0, "minutes_played": 1730, "upvotes_window": 647, "total_window": 887, "percent_window": 0.7294250281848929, "neu_sent": 0.771, "neg_sent": 0.082, "pos_sent": 0.147, "comp_sent": 0.9897, "neu_window": 0.6791159909909914, "neg_window": 0.08912950450450448, "pos_window": 0.22722184684684665, "comp_window": 0.3417047297297302, "percent_window_roc": 0.7863577863577864, "neu_window_roc": 0.8940670631604285, "neg_window_roc": 0.8057432432432432, "pos_window_roc": 0.6911116724200836, "comp_window_roc": 0.6611545756282597, "1day_forecast": -0.0031936421596924225, "1day_delta": 0.002152300912165561, "classification": 0.0, "neg_predict": 0.0041539340287269485, "pos_predict": 0.011452985251900312}, {"time_of_review": "2016-02-01T00:42:06", "review": "ark is one of the best dino games i ever played", "upvoted": true, "time_of_review_unix": 1454287326.0, "minutes_played": 3957, "upvotes_window": 630, "total_window": 865, "percent_window": 0.7283236994219653, "neu_sent": 0.548, "neg_sent": 0.0, "pos_sent": 0.452, "comp_sent": 0.765, "neu_window": 0.6804214780600462, "neg_window": 0.09263394919168588, "pos_window": 0.22229330254041543, "comp_window": 0.3425703233256352, "percent_window_roc": 0.7984163642362256, "neu_window_roc": 0.8939367256848848, "neg_window_roc": 0.7868690201253712, "pos_window_roc": 0.6942795680358004, "comp_window_roc": 0.6732911956565779, "1day_forecast": -0.0031775005915559706, "1day_delta": 0.0008462219444878016, "classification": 0.0, "neg_predict": 0.006972908557394539, "pos_predict": 0.006166699043922755}, {"time_of_review": "2016-02-02T00:09:08", "review": "If your looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if your looking for an outstanding cheese cake recipe you've come to the right place.\n\nIngredients: \n1 cup digestive plain sweet biscuit crumbs\n3 tablespoons sugar\n3 tablespoons melted butter\n40 ounces softened cream cheese\n1 cup sugar\n3 tablespoons flour\n1 tablespoon vanilla\n1 cup sour cream\n4 eggs\n\nDirections:\nFor The base:.\nIf you're using a dark pan, preheat the oven to 350.

He was seriously freakish to look at but I was high and thought it was funny. Within a half an hour I found 2 other players. I desperately wanted to chat with them so I started pressing the usual chat keys, but none of them were doing anything. However, one of them made my character do a silly yet creepy little whistle. So here I was, a terrifying gorilla looking dude who has no idea what he is supposed to be doing whistling over and over at these two dudes I didn't know. One of the guys started voice chatting and it turned out to be someone who couldn't have been older than 12. He was saying things like \"what do you want, man!? just get out of here! stop following us!\" and all the while I was just whistling and rubbing up against his character. He had a genuine quiver in his voice and was clearly terrified. Eventually they ran as fast as they could back to their dinky little fort and locked me outside. A few minutes later one of them opened the door to see if I was still there and I was standing RIGHT in the doorway and whistled again. He slammed the door and I heard the poor kid say \"that guy is FREAKING me out, derek!\" like he was going to cry. I don't think I have ever laughed harder than that in my life. Then I managed to craft an axe and waited outside their house until nightfall and attacked them while I whistled. They killed me, but it was worth it. I doubt they will ever forget the whistling monster named HugsAndWishes.\n\nIt is these non-scripted events that make ARK what it is. Those two moments are more unforgettable than anything a writer could have ever put me through in a single player game. \n\nEven though I don't have a lot of time to play ARK as it is quite a time sink, I still think it is worth the asking price even if you just explore for 5-10 hours. The island is seriously breathtaking and the community brings a lot of interesting humor to the gamepaly.", "upvoted": true, "time_of_review_unix": 1454630619.0, "minutes_played": 494, "upvotes_window": 590, "total_window": 815, "percent_window": 0.7239263803680982, "neu_sent": 0.781, "neg_sent": 0.129, "pos_sent": 0.09, "comp_sent": -0.9665, "neu_window": 0.6706299019607845, "neg_window": 0.09283088235294124, "pos_window": 0.22793014705882342, "comp_window": 0.3243693627450985, "percent_window_roc": 0.8221288515406162, "neu_window_roc": 0.8921450897981529, "neg_window_roc": 0.772452731092437, "pos_window_roc": 0.7024616700262659, "comp_window_roc": 0.6922944616443069, "1day_forecast": 0.007217171943337375, "1day_delta": -0.0025796437282873397, "classification": 0.0, "neg_predict": 0.026875030926592415, "pos_predict": 0.005255718870100546}, {"time_of_review": "2016-02-06T00:15:18", "review": "SO LAGGGGGGGYYYYYY I CAN'T EVEN PLAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n", "upvoted": false, "time_of_review_unix": 1454717718.0, "minutes_played": 84, "upvotes_window": 601, "total_window": 823, "percent_window": 0.7302551640340219, "neu_sent": 1.0, "neg_sent": 0.0, "pos_sent": 0.0, "comp_sent": 0.0, "neu_window": 0.6678398058252425, "neg_window": 0.09756310679611661, "pos_window": 0.2260788834951455, "comp_window": 0.3216646844660196, "percent_window_roc": 0.8238557558945908, "neu_window_roc": 0.8914860548014678, "neg_window_roc": 0.7649531900138696, "pos_window_roc": 0.7032029761364668, "comp_window_roc": 0.6880216317492761, "1day_forecast": -0.0027724850501882337, "1day_delta": 0.0063287836659237096, "classification": 0.0, "neg_predict": 0.02784156905059306, "pos_predict": 0.005542375816584624}, {"time_of_review": "2016-02-07T00:03:12", "review": "Without a doubt the worst survival game I have ever played, and not just on PC.

Don't even get me started on BattlEye because I've had so many bad experiences with this abomination labelled an anti-cheat.\n\nI hopped into an official server with my friend and from there I had 2 hours of gameplay, if that. Fast forward 2 hours and we were still searching for each other. I built a beautiful little thatch hut which was all for nothing because my tribe was somehow disbanded and I couldn't open any doors or demolish any walls because the thatch hut that I built wasn't owned by me anymore it was owned by my tribe that had decided to commit suicide and kick me out.\n\nSo I built another one, but this time my tribe didn't euthanize itself, my friend killed it. He made his own tribe apparently and invited me (TAKE NOTE THAT I DIDN'T ACCEPT ANY FORM OF INVITE WHATSOEVER). This destroyed my tribe and then rendered our new thatch house unusable even though I built it. That was my game experience and with only 9 hours of gameplay, I can say confidently that this game is far from finished. I witnessed the worst rubberbanding known to man, lag spikes that made it seem as if I was running on land but ended up being teleported backwards only to run straight off a cliff and die. If you step foot in a swamp you are met with a hungry level 106 Titanoboa. Too many problems to call ARK an actual game. I'm running 2 GTX 980's in SLI and I can only sit on medium settings with around 30-40 fps which still drops down to 20 at some moments.\n\nThe cons outweigh the pros like an elephant outweighs an ant. Don't waste your money on this 'game' even if it's on sale because you'll deeply regret it. It's unbalanced and uncared for, and from what I've seen they're spending more money on fucking modding contests than they are the actual game.\n\nEDIT - TFW WHEN YOU TAKE THE CARNO OUT FOR MEAT AND IT LITERALLY DESPAWNS RIGHT INFRONT OF YOUR EYES", "upvoted": false, "time_of_review_unix": 1458347306.0, "minutes_played": 10183, "upvotes_window": 634, "total_window": 891, "percent_window": 0.7115600448933782, "neu_sent": 0.821, "neg_sent": 0.104, "pos_sent": 0.074, "comp_sent": -0.9532, "neu_window": 0.6549529147982059, "neg_window": 0.09456502242152474, "pos_window": 0.24154372197309368, "comp_window": 0.30298071748878935, "percent_window_roc": 0.8545803971812941, "neu_window_roc": 0.859009266127545, "neg_window_roc": 0.7830317104420244, "pos_window_roc": 0.7683388514032661, "comp_window_roc": 0.6400951931398002, "1day_forecast": -0.004644567396122401, "1day_delta": -0.013409798291181496, "classification": 0.0, "neg_predict": 0.06121988337398822, "pos_predict": 0.02144329429944869}, {"time_of_review": "2016-03-20T00:03:08", "review": "This Game is so Amazing!!!!!!!", "upvoted": true, "time_of_review_unix": 1458432188.0, "minutes_played": 9707, "upvotes_window": 641, "total_window": 909, "percent_window": 0.7051705170517052, "neu_sent": 1.0, "neg_sent": 0.0, "pos_sent": 0.0, "comp_sent": 0.0, "neu_window": 0.6632560439560439, "neg_window": 0.09556043956043964, "pos_window": 0.23460989010988975, "comp_window": 0.2922385714285715, "percent_window_roc": 0.847723704866562, "neu_window_roc": 0.8594089489015938, "neg_window_roc": 0.7862637362637362, "pos_window_roc": 0.7634110437848756, "comp_window_roc": 0.636302294197031, "1day_forecast": 0.0011452724219790378, "1day_delta": -0.006389527841673015, "classification": 0.0, "neg_predict": 0.05532280462064039, "pos_predict": 0.01811821655627358}, {"time_of_review": "2016-03-21T00:15:13", "review": "I've sunk enough hours into this game and joined and left enough servers to be able to say this is a wonderful concept, but ultimately a broken game as far as online play goes.\n\nWant to only ever be attacked while you're offline or by players way better equipped and level than you?

Every time you die, you lose anything and everything you were working on and lose all your levels as well, so unless you are in a good tribe to where someone can re-invite you back if you die, start out in a PVE server in order to get the hang of the game, i have died from lvl 80 over 4x now and i admit i do cry a bit when i have to start over again.

Sometimes an update causes incompatiblity issues with mods, sometimes it just gets corrupted, and as such can get extremely frustrating having to deal with the problems. \n\nThe problems with the game are mostly balance issues, some dinosaurs are way too over-powered (Giga for instance).  The game also suffers from alot of weird deaths, you'll die...alot - sometimes, its your fault - other times its the games fault and you'll also lose alot of tamed dinosaurs the same way, heck I've lost a dinosaur to committed suicide by getting stuck on a standing torch...yes, the artifical stupidity is that bad sometimes. \n\nMore issues revolve around the placement of structures,  I get they went for simplicitity but sometimes, you just need better options to get the job done.  A prime example here is the power and cabling system, which is atrociously bad and really needs a major re-work, even with mods - its still a FusterCluck of a mess and something that the devs should really consider with a future patch.\n\nMods are a huge help to the game, but again - any modder will tell you that using them is at your own risk - which leads me to another issue, this game is still very similar to a roguelike, since its entirely possible to lose every single item your carrying when you die, sometimes when messing around with mods - those can even erase your character and force you to respawn, thus losing everything which can be very punishing when you lose everything to something that isn't really the players fault, sometimes dying due to a bug for instance. \n\nDinosaur taming again, since Dinosaurs are the main focus of the game and taming them as pets would be something enjoyable, but even this aspect of the game isn't without issues.  The requirements and even taming timers, especially the timers can be brutual - imagine spending countless hours, real time hours trying to tame a dinosaur? I'm sure some veterans could share many horror stories of the hours wasted taming - surely a better system could be done rather than spending as long as 24 hours taming something?   Sure, you could always play single player and greatly speed up the taming process, and even some private servers have increased taming speeds but not all. \n\nNow, for the positives - the game looks amazing, great flow and great potential once they can really work out some of the bugs and problems,  ARK 2 is something I would be invested in too if that ever saw the light of day.   Especially if they could get a better co-op system in place, rather than having a useless tethered helper on a non-dedicated server. \n\nI think ARK: Survival Evolved shows alot of promise provided they keep it in development and work at making the game more stable, more optimization and re-work some of the areas of the game where it fails, such as electrical cables. \n\n* Update 3.29.2016\n\nUninstalled the game, had enough of the unstable client and waiting until such a time when the game is fully released and more stable.  Mods is the best way to play, and unfortunately then can make the client even more unstable especially each time a new patch is released and practically breaks every mod. \n\nPros\n\nGreat Atmosphere\nGreat Graphics\nDinosaurs look realistic \nMod Support\n\nNegatives\n\nMany bugs and glitches\nElectrical cable system is bad\nWay too easy to die\nTamed Dinosaurs have bad A.I\nTerrible multiplayer\nUnstable and prone to hard crashes", "upvoted": false, "time_of_review_unix": 1459297596.0, "minutes_played": 8462, "upvotes_window": 752, "total_window": 1073, "percent_window": 0.700838769804287, "neu_sent": 0.661, "neg_sent": 0.181, "pos_sent": 0.157, "comp_sent": -0.9771, "neu_window": 0.6597690875232779, "neg_window": 0.08838361266294237, "pos_window": 0.2471890130353818, "comp_window": 0.3310062383612669, "percent_window_roc": 0.8097898377227987, "neu_window_roc": 0.8657079508728736, "neg_window_roc": 0.793096568236233, "pos_window_roc": 0.7512603189520644, "comp_window_roc": 0.6067659838609559, "1day_forecast": 0.009000587625431766, "1day_delta": -0.0015421825766652741, "classification": 0.0, "neg_predict": 0.017966661259728355, "pos_predict": 0.04832986291975527}, {"time_of_review": "2016-03-31T00:14:00", "review": "This game is addictive and beautiful.  \n\nCons:\nI had to upgrade my graphics card :(\nServer lag seems to be common placed.\nThe game features a mechanic that could potentially allow one or more players to prevent one or more other players from continuing the game on a given server.\n\nPros:\nI had a reason to upgrade my graphics card :D\nPrivate servers allow drastic customization of game mechanics.\nI RODE A T-REX!", "upvoted": true, "time_of_review_unix": 1459383240.0, "minutes_played": 37445, "upvotes_window": 707, "total_window": 996, "percent_window": 0.7098393574297188, "neu_sent": 0.759, "neg_sent": 0.068, "pos_sent": 0.172, "comp_sent": 0.7957, "neu_window": 0.6578776328986957, "neg_window": 0.08768104312938821, "pos_window": 0.2494212637913743, "comp_window": 0.33538736208625924, "percent_window_roc": 0.804699813726895, "neu_window_roc": 0.8677512573746458, "neg_window_roc": 0.7860008597220232, "pos_window_roc": 0.7467886525620475, "comp_window_roc": 0.6050607964243607, "1day_forecast": 0.003213501254207829, "1day_delta": 0.009000587625431766, "classification": 0.0, "neg_predict": 0.015762366652905355, "pos_predict": 0.06146744682211691}, {"time_of_review": "2016-04-01T00:10:39", "review": "Don't eat for 5 mins, starve to death", "upvoted": false, "time_of_review_unix": 1459469439.0, "minutes_played": 376, "upvotes_window": 661, "total_window": 927, "percent_window": 0.7130528586839266, "neu_sent": 0.424, "neg_sent": 0.576, "pos_sent": 0.0, "comp_sent": -0.7783, "neu_window": 0.657463362068965, "neg_window": 0.08646336206896556, "pos_window": 0.25067241379310373, "comp_window": 0.34245840517241405, "percent_window_roc": 0.8017241379310345, "neu_window_roc": 0.8683200007246453, "neg_window_roc": 0.789370381773399, "pos_window_roc": 0.7486035019873241, "comp_window_roc": 0.6065676043557169, "1day_forecast": 0.011365745967236163, "1day_delta": 0.003213501254207829, "classification": 0.0, "neg_predict": 0.012372150942787768, "pos_predict": 0.06798995040908858}, {"time_of_review": "2016-04-02T00:26:12", "review": "It brings you back in time to bring you the ability to meet people and create tribes.

I didn't know anything and everyone was after my poor-ass. Then I get back to it with a crew this time. We got our shit together and try-harded, we made a bring good base and raided some guys.\n\nSo, to the gameplay, near the beginning, the game is very grindy, but still a bit fun. It all depends on what happens to you during this grindy period of time. You could meet other tribes and have a good time, or you could meet no one which could suck.  After the grind, (usually when you have a base and simple things) you can start taming animals. Once you obtain a Trike taming animals is relatively easy and makes the game more fun. Each dino has a different ability. This makes the game a lot easier and that's why the game stops being a grind. I would say this ARK and the experiences are very fun, however, the grind needs to be looked past. \n\nI did not play this game on PC I did on my console, only because my friends had it on there which is a pain, knowing it wazs better looking on my build.", "upvoted": true, "time_of_review_unix": 1459817123.0, "minutes_played": 52, "upvotes_window": 586, "total_window": 781, "percent_window": 0.7503201024327785, "neu_sent": 0.741, "neg_sent": 0.077, "pos_sent": 0.182, "comp_sent": 0.9789, "neu_window": 0.6553849104859333, "neg_window": 0.0807647058823529, "pos_window": 0.2625613810741688, "comp_window": 0.4144892583120207, "percent_window_roc": 0.8067226890756303, "neu_window_roc": 0.866847970049623, "neg_window_roc": 0.7515756302521008, "pos_window_roc": 0.7648731983650835, "comp_window_roc": 0.6604747162022704, "1day_forecast": 0.010432585739264533, "1day_delta": 0.00838461856181072, "classification": 0.0, "neg_predict": 0.007520209047229378, "pos_predict": 0.04932291432500742}, {"time_of_review": "2016-04-06T00:06:42", "review": "this remieds me of ark  with hacker wars lol XD https://youtu.be/iAqt7dERWJs", "upvoted": true, "time_of_review_unix": 1459901202.0, "minutes_played": 39044, "upvotes_window": 569, "total_window": 748, "percent_window": 0.7606951871657754, "neu_sent": 0.423, "neg_sent": 0.19, "pos_sent": 0.387, "comp_sent": 0.5766, "neu_window": 0.6577369826435244, "neg_window": 0.07944993324432577, "pos_window": 0.2614699599465955, "comp_window": 0.4198024032042727, "percent_window_roc": 0.8102231546824337, "neu_window_roc": 0.8663030743683463, "neg_window_roc": 0.7505721914934198, "pos_window_roc": 0.7694579272883054, "comp_window_roc": 0.6787998032464337, "1day_forecast": 0.002247592125777742, "1day_delta": 0.010375084732996975, "classification": 0.0, "neg_predict": 0.00659385479203125, "pos_predict": 0.04252631953459823}, {"time_of_review": "2016-04-07T00:22:56", "review": "1.entered game\n2.wandered around mad cause i couldnt find trex\n3.saw one, immediatly exited game and curled up in a ball sucking my thumb", "upvoted": true, "time_of_review_unix": 1459988576.0, "minutes_played": 46033, "upvotes_window": 561, "total_window": 735, "percent_window": 0.763265306122449, "neu_sent": 0.868, "neg_sent": 0.132, "pos_sent": 0.0, "comp_sent": -0.4939, "neu_window": 0.6540883152173907, "neg_window": 0.08084646739130434, "pos_window": 0.2636888586956523, "comp_window": 0.42384429347826147, "percent_window_roc": 0.8152173913043478, "neu_window_roc": 0.8654777093965776, "neg_window_roc": 0.7406832298136645, "pos_window_roc": 0.7745835026412027, "comp_window_roc": 0.6990131578947368, "1day_forecast": 0.0021667926429830286, "1day_delta": 0.0025126179504060264, "classification": 0.0, "neg_predict": 0.009245845381298409, "pos_predict": 0.036313246772780666}, {"time_of_review": "2016-04-08T00:39:26", "review": "had many good times on this game will continue to keep playing just getting tired of every one joinign servers for free handouts.", "upvoted": true, "time_of_review_unix": 1460075966.0, "minutes_played": 20013, "upvotes_window": 558, "total_window": 729, "percent_window": 0.7654320987654321, "neu_sent": 0.635, "neg_sent": 0.097, "pos_sent": 0.268, "comp_sent": 0.6249, "neu_window": 0.6508164383561639, "neg_window": 0.08329178082191782, "pos_window": 0.2645150684931509, "comp_window": 0.41857534246575384, "percent_window_roc": 0.8203522504892369, "neu_window_roc": 0.8653647964534079, "neg_window_roc": 0.7351027397260275, "pos_window_roc": 0.7809499423889388, "comp_window_roc": 0.7158135063686614, "1day_forecast": 0.009991630048127309, "1day_delta": 0.0022385940293021545, "classification": 0.0, "neg_predict": 0.013633052355760292, "pos_predict": 0.03449046561958048}, {"time_of_review": "2016-04-09T00:09:09", "review": "ark is dog shit", "upvoted": true, "time_of_review_unix": 1460160549.0, "minutes_played": 6242, "upvotes_window": 547, "total_window": 706, "percent_window": 0.7747875354107648, "neu_sent": 0.455, "neg_sent": 0.545, "pos_sent": 0.0, "comp_sent": -0.5574, "neu_window": 0.6546294200848648, "neg_window": 0.08384299858557284, "pos_window": 0.26011598302687433, "comp_window": 0.4236881188118817, "percent_window_roc": 0.8276419478682563, "neu_window_roc": 0.8636706231844611, "neg_window_roc": 0.7228733077389371, "pos_window_roc": 0.7843240932905039, "comp_window_roc": 0.7333928881609966, "1day_forecast": -0.011629640673922692, "1day_delta": 0.009355436645332782, "classification": 0.0, "neg_predict": 0.014452685966325164, "pos_predict": 0.022602035099895158}, {"time_of_review": "2016-04-10T00:08:00", "review": "Definitely recomend this game!

Meat recovered inconsistent with size of animal; and acquiring Hide vs. Meat is pick vs. hatchet. This leads to unrealistic harvesting, and tends to make the mechanic seem like it was just slapped on. It was.\n\nWater req. 1 every 3 days about; just a little drink. It's tropical, an island; assume the water is saline. Food req. is extremely high. The player is forced to eat so regularly that it completely destroys any semblance of realism. 2-3 dino's a day depending on what you get from them. A single Dodo would realistically be enough to feed a person for 2-3 days.\n\nFor a survival game, the Devs seem to have developed next to no knowledge of actual survival req. Heat and cold are prevalent, with the player freezing or overheating extremely fast. Leaving a campfire at night is brief. Exercise/activity does not keep you warm, or seem to influence this.\n\nActual survival elements are trivial. Needing a pick to make a hatchet, and gather flint is silly. You can find flint on a beach if it is prevalent. You are not likely to find it in a rock, unless it is sedimentary. Too many inconsistencies; unrealistic requirements for building. Unrealistic materials and sources. Thatch is not tree splinters; it is grass, reeds, palm leaves. All it takes is a quick google to figure that out.\n\nSinew. You need it to properly secure stone and flint for arrow/spear heads and axe heads. Temporary use of fibers from grass, bark, or other sources will serve briefly, and mostly ineffectively. A simple rock can be made into a cutting implement with another rock. Bone can be splintered for spearheads, cutting/piercing tools, or knives with rock. A rock is going to be more effective to break up a tree than your fists. You can even use rock wedges to split them, with a rock for a hammer.\n\nGrubs, berries, (edible), insects, etc... can feed a person well enough to survive on with minimal activity. Raw fish is often more than edible, (species dependent), and a hardwood stick a piece of sharp rock to scrape shavings, a little moss, and a softwood base with a hole gouged in it are all you need to start a fire if you can keep everything dry long enough to do so.\n\nRoaming of creatures is inconsistent too. There are dangerous creatures everywhere, not in packs for those that should be, and with zero territorial dominance of any species. Species that should be loners except for mating seasons, are hanging out on the beach, and heard animals are in small groups of 2-3, or completely alone.\n\nPredators wander everywhere, do not follow consistent hunting patterns or logic, (detracts from survival knowledge of environment and species), etc...

Don't buy this game.\n\nThe current state of this game (Writing this review may of 2016) is unbelievably unoptimized, and it shows. I have a GTX 960 overclocked to around 1400 mhz and this game runs like absolute GARBAGE, and looks horrible to boot. For the last, I don't know, 6 or so months the developers have had \"DX 12 update, 20% performance increase!\" in the \"A little further out\" portion of the patch notes and if you do research you'll see they won't be updating to DX 12 any time soon because they can't seem to get it to perform better than DX 11, it actually performs WORSE. Also, If you're planning on playing this game alone, on a multiplayer or single player server, you're gonna die a LOT. Like, I mean constantly. It's gonna be a lot of running around collecting resources and killing dodos to level up your survivor before you can have ANY fun with this game because running into a high level aggressive dinosaur early on is DEATH in this game, and the dino population in this game is RIDICULOUSLY dense. I really like the concept of this game and I honestly had fun with it for the first couple of weeks, but it's been in devoplement for a long time now and it seems like they keep releasing new dinos and are really neglecting fixing the performance issues, which almost make this game unplayable for me.

I suspect new players starting on official servers is why so many quit the game so quickly.\n\nI strongly suggest everyone new to this game starts on an unofficial server and look for servers that have multipliers to gathering, taming and xp. Start with very high multipliers such as 15x. This will give you a good feel for the game and a lot of these servers are moderated well with offline raiding prohibited.\n\nSoon enough you will find these servers a little boring as they make the game too easy but like I said the base game can be difficult and grindy to a newcomer so think of these modded servers as beginner tutorial modes.\n\nIf you want a game that provides hundreds if not thousands of hours of addictive gameplay, this is it.

My PC is very good and I haven't had trouble running any games, but I am lucky to get 30 FPS in Ark. Putting the poor optimization aside the community is awful. I'm all for competition, but being picked off at spawn and returning to the game to find I have lost what little progress I've managed to make (very slow leveling) is beyond frustrating. The players are rude and they make it impossible to play the game the way to is intened. Unless you can play this game 24/7 DO NOT BUY. You will never be able to do anything, even tame a decent dino unless you have no other desire than to play this game. I know you can play on your own but the game just wasn't meant to be played that way and gets dull very quickly. \n\nIf you are like me, you will ignor the bad reveiws and believe the hype.

There are many different dino's that you can tame with different uniqueish aspects about them.\n2. There are a number of different environments in the game. This includes underwater and underground enviroments.\n3. The stat and leveling system make it to where people and dino's of the same level can have drastically different uses.\n4. You have a lot of freedom as to what to build.\n5. You can work out partnerships and trade with other peole and tribes.\n\nThe negatives:\n1. There are severe lag issues with the servers. They constantly happen and last about 5 to 10 seconds.\n2.  Dino's can randomly spawn and despawn. This can be frustratiing for a variety of reasons. Rarely is it positive.\n3. The lag spikes can kill you and/or your dino's. Theycan sometimes place you or your creatures in the wrong spot when the rubberbanding ends. I've magically ended in the air off a cliff more than once from these spikes.\n4. Pillaring is an issue. Some pillar to protect valuable resources. Some to keep others from building to close to them. some just to hold a place that that they might want to build on later. This is bad for any new players to a server. Servers tend to be pillared very quicly so new players find it hard to impossible to find a place to build. People don't like giving up any of that land either. This system needs to be fixed or replaced. My tribe often invites new players into our tribe because they can't find a place to build.\n5. Customer support WILL NOT HELP YOU. They will only help if you have a verifiably screenshot of a glitch. As you can imagine, there are many many situations where a screenshot after the fact would prove nothing. But that is all they will accept. I had a Mammoth just up and die from full health and they told me I needed a screenshot. When I asked how they could verify the glitch with a screenshot of my dead Mammoth, they ended the ticket. DO NOT EXPECT HELP FROM THEM AS IT WILL NOT BE COMING.\n6. PVP is virtually impossible to play solo. You'll constantly get robbed and killed. If you're naked and have nothing...they'll take your life. You MUST join a big tribe to have any kind of security at all.\n7. The temperature stuff is ridiculous. You can freeze to death in the tropics. The Snow and Lava biomes seem to be the only places where the weather is consistent.\n8. Some items are completely useless in PVE unlike PVP. They don't tell you this in the description for these items. You need to look it up yourself.\n\nI'm sur there are things I forgot to list on both but I'll update them at a later date. The game has potential to be good, just not in it's current state. I couldn't recommend anyone buying it at its current price point.

Untill minutes ago when I tried playing again on the PC and it crashed my whole computer. I will stick by my bad review for this game because they still have crap like that happening. My system more than meets the minimum requirments for this game and still it malfunctions and has problems. I will say this though, the game is pretty damn amazing on the Xbox one. That's where i do all of my playing now. I have my own private server that is constantly running so my friends can play all they want even. I suggest if you have a potato PC dont buy this game for it, buy it on the Xbox or PS. This game has too many problems on the PC for it to be worth the buy. On the Xbox i have some lag still but it's not that big of a problem unless i log onto a European server......which i don't recommened unless you want to be cussed out in Belgian.....yes, that has happened. There are still tons of bugs they need to fix before I'll give this game a positive review. For example, they still have dinos and players falling through the ground never to be seen or heard from again. This is unacceptable considering how long this game has been out for. It's like i'm playing an old spyro game or something else from the 90's and those games didn't have it happen as much as this one does.\n\n All in all I'd say I logged massive amounts of game time on my Xbox since i was playing it on there the day it came out for the system. I would expect bugs on there, but not to the degree that they occur. This game still has problems despite being out for a very long time. So, because of that......I must maintain my No Recommendation.\n\nI would love to write an outstanding review for this game and probably would if it weren't for some pretty bad game breaking problems. The idea is amazing and the execution is pretty well done. However, the server lag is pretty much a game killer. The only real way you can play this game is with a better than average computer. If you have anything less than a custom made gaming computer dont buy this game, dont even look at it or it could make your computer freeze. I had a level 55 trike and when i tried to cross a river at a crossing the server lagged and my trike drowned. It took me close to 2 hours just to get the trike and then another 30 hours to get it to that lvl. The thing that really ticked me off about this is that i was playing it on the extremely low memory setting with the graphics set to the absolute minimum and it still had server lag. If the devs plan on adding any more dinosour species they should probably bolster their servers first and make it so they can handle the new additions. At this point for an average gamer like myself, who can only afford an $800 to $900 computer it is extremely difficult and sometimes down right frustrating to play on the servers.", "upvoted": false, "time_of_review_unix": 1467245381.0, "minutes_played": 6093, "upvotes_window": 740, "total_window": 999, "percent_window": 0.7407407407407407, "neu_sent": 0.765, "neg_sent": 0.113, "pos_sent": 0.122, "comp_sent": 0.1034, "neu_window": 0.6579579999999989, "neg_window": 0.08436000000000005, "pos_window": 0.25569400000000014, "comp_window": 0.3177072, "percent_window_roc": 0.8811428571428571, "neu_window_roc": 0.8506409486640649, "neg_window_roc": 0.6814285714285714, "pos_window_roc": 0.838006230529595, "comp_window_roc": 0.724298245614035, "1day_forecast": 0.0034235916588858384, "1day_delta": -0.023304203079484, "classification": 0.0, "neg_predict": 0.47973144689443853, "pos_predict": 0.0169222498322244}, {"time_of_review": "2016-07-01T00:08:50", "review": "ARK: Survival Evolved really brings out the social dynamics of a dog-eat-dog survival.

It will be brewakeing for u by ur self in pvp servers is not possible. its way too difficult specially if u don't have any friends for the first time playing. you'll realize the resource gathering takes insane amount of time. which for me i don't have time to play this game except people with no lives play this game. It's like having a job in a video game well things will be an lot faster the more people are in the tribe. That unfortunately won't work well in the game but redit helps an lot of problem's. It'll  take time for someone to be recruited but it pays off once a clan accept''s u makes things easier on ur self, but of course they wont trust u at first but in the end it pays off they'll most likely help u build your first house. which doesn't sound bad idea for awhile but the tribe will need a capital of their tribe where most of tribes resource goes. I like this idea  but the question is does the tribe suit u or not? you have to take it in consideration if a tribe is a ass**** than probably shouldn't stay in the tribe too long. Any way once u solve all the manpower problem than the next step is tameing. Tameing takes a long time depending wat type of food u use it take along time in like regular raw meat vs prime meat which spoils fast for predators but the pray u use berry's or man made cat or dog food i don't remember the name. That type of food can reduce time HUGE i mean HUGE. Any how makeing the stuff is expensive as it's going to get. Every item in the game is expensive the higher tier u go.

Don't get me wrong.  This isn't a bad game per se.  If you have even less of a life than an unemployed social recluse you'll be able to become truly epic.  But most people will never actually have the time to access the majority of the content in it even with a large tribe helping them out.  It's basically a free to play game with everything that entails, except with a thirty dollar up front charge instead of microtransactions throughout.  Not saying that's better or worse.  Just that that's how it's designed.  It's one of those games where you play for 322 hours not because you just want to keep playing, but because everything just takes so long and stopping before a certain point will result in hours of lost progress.  Want to raise a baby dinosaur?  Be prepared to be online in close proximity to the hatchling for literally 4 to 9 hours as you have to manually refill it's inventory with food every few seconds.  Want to get the imprinting bonus?  Well you have to personally interact with the baby literally every 4 hours real time even after it's able to feed itself.  I'm not misusing the word litterally.\n\nOh yeah, and way too often the game just says \"fuck you\" and glitches out and removes your progress anyway.\n\nAnd I spent most of my time playing on an unofficial server with the timers speeded up and stack sizes increased...\n\nIf none of this actually bothers you, then the game is fucking brilliant.  It's got tons of content and can be really amazing at times.  If that kind of thing does bother you I can't really reccomend it.  Of course it does take a while for the game's probalems to really sink in, so maybe you'll get your money's worth before you get burned out and fed up.", "upvoted": false, "time_of_review_unix": 1471739189.0, "minutes_played": 19370, "upvotes_window": 481, "total_window": 650, "percent_window": 0.74, "neu_sent": 0.796, "neg_sent": 0.05, "pos_sent": 0.154, "comp_sent": 0.9868, "neu_window": 0.6741382488479266, "neg_window": 0.08863594470046075, "pos_window": 0.23571121351766514, "comp_window": 0.34141674347158213, "percent_window_roc": 0.7794601711652404, "neu_window_roc": 0.8731379246578596, "neg_window_roc": 0.8243087557603686, "pos_window_roc": 0.7321590077092037, "comp_window_roc": 0.6043334141806127, "1day_forecast": -0.005337423312883449, "1day_delta": 0.0010687022900762733, "classification": -1.0, "neg_predict": 0.0016891523874689152, "pos_predict": 0.06946119309776562}, {"time_of_review": "2016-08-22T01:11:36", "review": "so much fun. everything you hope it to be :)", "upvoted": true, "time_of_review_unix": 1471828296.0, "minutes_played": 43491, "upvotes_window": 476, "total_window": 647, "percent_window": 0.7357032457496137, "neu_sent": 0.425, "neg_sent": 0.0, "pos_sent": 0.575, "comp_sent": 0.8583, "neu_window": 0.6812206790123458, "neg_window": 0.08417592592592595, "pos_window": 0.23308333333333303, "comp_window": 0.34480709876543225, "percent_window_roc": 0.7901234567901234, "neu_window_roc": 0.8751450089136469, "neg_window_roc": 0.8149801587301586, "pos_window_roc": 0.730741125341333, "comp_window_roc": 0.6195852285033571, "1day_forecast": -0.010664843291856352, "1day_delta": -0.005037494991127045, "classification": 0.0, "neg_predict": 0.002586622078501009, "pos_predict": 0.03716219435156411}, {"time_of_review": "2016-08-23T00:06:20", "review": "22.06.2015: Not really very good for more then a few hours.

To those developers whom create content that can be enjoyed by a broad base of people, Congrats. Also on that subject if you are in early access and release payable content, you had better have one hell of a game to bargain with. Ark IS on of those games. Yes I realise that they had a majour lawsuit on there hands and had to push out some content that was going to be saved for after launch. Well done and I hope you recover quickly and continue to give us more content and fixes! I am not a cheap console warrior. Nor do I support a cheap computer. Pc is the top platform and deserves the highest possible outcome that it can get. Which means I own 2 high performace computers. How? I saved my money instead of blowing it. One is an amd 8350 4.5ghz with 16gb ddr3 1666mhz and a GTX 980 strix. The other is an Intel 6700k 4.0ghz 16gb ddr4 and an 1080 founders edition. Both computers dont have any hiccups, performance issues or screen tearing. I find this game visually stunning, and entertaining beyond all belief. Dont kid yourself with my low hours I have logged well over 2000 hours privately. Im tired of people giving bad reviews for this game. It's way better than all in its genere and exceeds all expectations that you could want. Dont let people fool you, the move to add payed content was smart and needed to help push this game where it needs to go. Screw all the people bitching about paying for some dlc thats in early access. This is a Triple A title that could easily sell for 70 dollars a pop plus 40 dollars per expansion. (And people are bitching about 20 bucks Really? go work 2 hours (or go mow somebodys lawn) and buy it) Because we all know you have logged well over 100 hours in this game. Yes the game has bugs, some more brutal than others but most are small. To be expected. Stop crying about a damn good game that gives out payable content. You want to bitch out a company for out-rageous dlc go to EA. Sims 3 for all its content is worth over 400 dollars. NOW THAT is a scam. Let the men and women that work on ARK do the job they set out to do without all your uneducated crying over paying for Solid dlc on a Solid game.", "upvoted": true, "time_of_review_unix": 1473897680.0, "minutes_played": 40049, "upvotes_window": 1756, "total_window": 5857, "percent_window": 0.2998121905412327, "neu_sent": 0.788, "neg_sent": 0.097, "pos_sent": 0.115, "comp_sent": -0.8033, "neu_window": 0.7552850802321631, "neg_window": 0.1033649709798566, "pos_window": 0.13913963810174151, "comp_window": 0.16601505633321922, "percent_window_roc": 0.35253377554504217, "neu_window_roc": 0.9885545522015633, "neg_window_roc": 0.8564386918987464, "pos_window_roc": 0.4589405121627213, "comp_window_roc": 0.32236617491150205, "1day_forecast": 0.013764028418346785, "1day_delta": -0.00022202088538381126, "classification": 0.0, "neg_predict": 0.001987125586173138, "pos_predict": 0.07159978244957141}, {"time_of_review": "2016-09-16T00:18:07", "review": "its ok i guess", "upvoted": true, "time_of_review_unix": 1473985087.0, "minutes_played": 47912, "upvotes_window": 1719, "total_window": 5462, "percent_window": 0.31471988282680335, "neu_sent": 0.476, "neg_sent": 0.0, "pos_sent": 0.524, "comp_sent": 0.296, "neu_window": 0.7538390993959371, "neg_window": 0.10307706388431273, "pos_window": 0.14089547867472105, "comp_window": 0.174924382207578, "percent_window_roc": 0.3225857064407312, "neu_window_roc": 0.9950922812360745, "neg_window_roc": 0.8684690515415392, "pos_window_roc": 0.43966120426112115, "comp_window_roc": 0.2958177982022602, "1day_forecast": 0.062317844234211994, "1day_delta": 0.014958872242986365, "classification": 0.0, "neg_predict": 0.0005272214287684563, "pos_predict": 0.15658915933805612}, {"time_of_review": "2016-09-17T00:05:42", "review": "I have thoroughly enjoyed this game and while releasing paid DLC for a Early Access game is bad practice; the developers are to blame and it does not reflect on the game's quality.

However it would seem that you need a PC built by NASA in order to get a smooth and good looking experience. My PC isnt the greatest, but it should definetely be able to run this game looking good and a fair fps. Instead i am looking up guides on youtube, trying to go through the games files to optimize it myself so i can run it at the bare minumum. Wildcard, OPTIMIZE THIS FREAKING GAME. OPTIMIZE IT ALOT! The next biggest problem? Pre-Release DLC. WTF even is that? Ive never even seen that on any other game ive ever played! Why is that even allowed? C'mon Wildcard, slow down.

I launched it again after eight months to see if anything had improved, and I was very dissapointed. Single Player wouldn't even load to the map anymore, the server list had only a fraction of active servers that it did in it's prime, and everything was identical, save for maybe the addition of an amount of creatures I could count on one hand. The same grindy, repetitive gameplay, the same piss-poor performance, the same extreme level of difficulty (I was killed by wild animals within ten seconds four of the times I respawned), the same.. everything.

I would love to say all these hours ive spent in game have been worth every penny, but the truth is the frustrations of a broken game FAR out number the amount of good times had.\n\nUPDATE: This company is a joke, they cant make deadlines and have done nothing but deliver short on their promises for a while now. the promised features of Fear Evolved 2 are a great example of their utter failure in communication with their player base. almost none of the features they promised were introduced and they didnt bother saying anything TIL THE UPDATE WAS ALREADY LIVE.", "upvoted": false, "time_of_review_unix": 1477702142.0, "minutes_played": 111774, "upvotes_window": 416, "total_window": 616, "percent_window": 0.6753246753246753, "neu_sent": 0.763, "neg_sent": 0.091, "pos_sent": 0.146, "comp_sent": 0.9518, "neu_window": 0.6876418152350079, "neg_window": 0.08541653160453809, "pos_window": 0.22371150729335496, "comp_window": 0.32793160453808756, "percent_window_roc": 0.7483213706876591, "neu_window_roc": 0.8998777264019984, "neg_window_roc": 0.6764586709886548, "pos_window_roc": 0.7119162665293325, "comp_window_roc": 0.7324632488839603, "1day_forecast": 0.016983016983016963, "1day_delta": 0.00040718357550040274, "classification": 0.0, "neg_predict": 0.14154676943884084, "pos_predict": 0.006753746568579097}, {"time_of_review": "2016-10-30T00:45:36", "review": "It is a good  around game.

First off, if you're wondering wether or not you'd be interested in this game, DON'T listen to all the negative reviews talking about the new paid DLC. It's unfair based on the state of the game (which is better than most games you can find that are fully realeased). Plus, you shouldn't worry about the DLC if you don't even have the game yet.\n\nARK is an early access game, meaning bugs are present. A lot of people are writing negative reviews because of a bug that annoyed them, which is unfair to the developers who are trying their best to keep the game functioning. Unlike other games where the developers aren't too active, or don't fix glitches often enough, the makers of ARK are constantly adding new dinosaurs while trying to fix glitches (such as the health bar glitch). As I said, bugs are present, but there are no major issues. Imo, ARK is an extremely fun game with rich content that can (and will if you let it) amuse you for hours.\n\nAnother thing I'm going to bring up before I get into the main stuff is my first experience with the game. No, I'm not one of those OG players, and haven't played for 1k+ hours like a lot of people I know. My introduction to ARK came from a YouTuber I watched (Vikkstar123). He and his friends were playing on a personal server, learning about the game together and getting to the endgame stuff. Although it was painful to watch for more experienced players, I was mezmorized by the idea of a dinosaur survival game as good-looking as this one. Eventually I did get the game, and was thankfully able to run it on my Mac (thanks for not being Windows only game like SOME games...). The only problem was I was using defalt settings. This means it would take forever to level things up, gather recources, and tame dinosaurs (the main point of the game imo). That would be my first recommendation-- turn up the taming, gathering, and xp rates. I eventually tamed my first dinosaur (which was a dinosaur I DEFINITELY shouldn't have gotten as my first), a Pachy, which I loved because it looked like a fossil Pokemon. Although when I did manage to tame it, it ended up dying within about five minutes of me having it to a couple of dinos. As this was my very first tame, I was heartbroken to have lost it so soon. I ended up putting off ARK for a while until I came back and gave it another go. Moral: turn rates up + tame dinos you're supposed to tame.\n\nNow, back to what you want. Some things about the game you need to know if you're considering buying. You'll most likely end up spending time on servers, connecting with other users who love to play like you do. If you're into the idea of having PvP with dinosaurs and tribes (which does sound awesome), you should probably give that up. Unless you have almost no life, or 20-30 people to join your tribe, the idea of PvP should be out of your head. There will always be that alpha tribe who loves to level your base or kill your dinosaurs you worked for for fun. You'll be offline raided, online raided, or taunted. I'm not saying you shouldn't give it a go, I'm saying prepare to lose a lot of dinos and work along the way. However, for the more solo players, PvE servers can be amazing. I love PvE, especially on the server I play on (which has nice Admins). It's probably my favorite part of ARK other than the mods. The last type of server is official. This has the normal rates for everything, and if anything is lost to a glitch or bug, it will NOT be replaced. I honestly do NOT reccomend official to those who don't have hours on end to play this game. As I said with PvP, give it a try. You may like it better than I do.\n\nThe very last thing I'm talking about in length is the mods you can get. These are the player-created addons to the game which can make your experience more challenging, more fun, or just make some things a LOT easier. Some I'd reccomend are Structures Plus, where if you place something down you can pick it up again instead of having to destroy it, Recource Stacker, where you can hold a lot more of an object in a stack (meaning things like berries or meats will spoil less), and Annuaki Genesis, where there's TONS more to do including taming boss creatures, alphas, and posion/fire/earth/ice dinosaurs (not reccomended to beginers).\n\nLooking back, I may have ranted a bit on this review, but I still hope it helps you. Here's a recap:\n\nPROS:\n- Great graphics\n- Active and friendly Devs\n- Rich content\n- Lots and lots of dinosaurs that all have their own use\n- Fantastic survival game\n- Very customizable servers\n- Massive tribes can enjoy the aspect of PvP\n\nCONS:\n- PvP is really not a choice for small tribes / solo players\n- A lot of minor bugs that take a while to fix\n- Too little focus on early game content (more on end game)\n- Bad building system (mods like Structures Plus can fix this)\n- No \"creative\" mode for Mods / Admins of servers (or even singleplayer)\n- No stealth system (hiding from dinos)\n- No dino pathing (they always seem to run into rocks or walls or get stuck in trees)\n\nI do reccomend this game though. If you can get over the fact that once in a while you're gonna run into a bug or crash, then I highly urge you to buy the game. It's my all-time favorite and I hope it can maybe become one of yours :)", "upvoted": true, "time_of_review_unix": 1478653365.0, "minutes_played": 33845, "upvotes_window": 364, "total_window": 557, "percent_window": 0.6535008976660682, "neu_sent": 0.765, "neg_sent": 0.077, "pos_sent": 0.158, "comp_sent": 0.9985, "neu_window": 0.6639444444444448, "neg_window": 0.08443010752688165, "pos_window": 0.2444462365591398, "comp_window": 0.3029220430107523, "percent_window_roc": 0.7578084997439837, "neu_window_roc": 0.8910328627888985, "neg_window_roc": 0.7327188940092166, "pos_window_roc": 0.7146127134068044, "comp_window_roc": 0.6291265798905866, "1day_forecast": -0.01165692603486257, "1day_delta": 0.01424856121747009, "classification": 0.0, "neg_predict": 0.120994506064561, "pos_predict": 0.04343027479232367}, {"time_of_review": "2016-11-10T00:02:25", "review": "Spawned-\nBuilt a wooden house, tamed some dinos life is good-\nRandom tribe starts to build next to me-\nThey decide im taking up too much of their surrounding recources-\nThey kill me and all of my dinos and tell me not to come back-\nRespawn- \nTame a level 94 carno, and name it 'revenge' so that everytime it destroys something the screen would flash\"Your Revenge has slain a level 16 trike\"-\nReturn to their base and watch with contemp as my revenge destroys everything they have-\n\n12/10 would destroy my enemys with my Revenge again :3", "upvoted": true, "time_of_review_unix": 1478736145.0, "minutes_played": 72921, "upvotes_window": 363, "total_window": 564, "percent_window": 0.6436170212765957, "neu_sent": 0.728, "neg_sent": 0.219, "pos_sent": 0.053, "comp_sent": -0.9657, "neu_window": 0.659695575221239, "neg_window": 0.08684247787610615, "pos_window": 0.24637522123893815, "comp_window": 0.30786920353982244, "percent_window_roc": 0.7565107458912769, "neu_window_roc": 0.8893303188338032, "neg_window_roc": 0.738716814159292, "pos_window_roc": 0.7167865905770132, "comp_window_roc": 0.6213320912901723, "1day_forecast": -0.0035460992907800915, "1day_delta": -0.009883876389472523, "classification": 0.0, "neg_predict": 0.11636813629834379, "pos_predict": 0.04405032981021583}, {"time_of_review": "2016-11-11T00:07:48", "review": "Serious problem with chinese players griefing a ton of servers.

The game Itself is great, Its fun and challenging all at the same time. It can be a bit of a grind on 'Official' Servers as taming takes hours and building a good enough base to survive from other players will take a VERY long time.\nBut hey, If thats not for you then hop onto an 'Unofficial' Server, Taming is ALOT faster and building a decent base will still take a while but no-where near as long.\nThe game has a HUGE amount of tamable and ride-able dinosaurs in the base game, On certain modded servers (Unofficial) you can play around with even more dinos due to certain mods that will add more.\nThere are dinos that will suit anyones needs, from flying dinosaurs to dinosaurs that swim; and not to forget, the land dinosaurs. Not all of which are ride-able but they are ALL tamable.\n\nThere are hundreds of servers that support up to 70 people.\n\nNow, I say 'Kinda' for a reason. The game is defiantly  not without flaw, Dinos can, rarely, disappear and sometimes you may lose some stuff out of thin air. But that's to be expected.\nThe game is also terribly optimised, I have a GTX 1070 - 16GB RAM - and an i7 - 6700k, On high, not epic, settings, the game struggles to maintain a constant 60 fps; Mainly sitting at 40 - 50fps in the wilderness - anywhere from 20 - 30fps (sometimes less) in bigger bases.\n\nNow that the main bit is out of the way I'm gonna talk about some somewhat 'controversial' topic, Which is..... The decision to release a \u00a314.99 ($19.99) DLC.\nPersonally, I don't give a sh*t, and i'm not gonna give it a thumbs down because of that 1 thing.\nThe DLC is NOT forced upon you, and is certainly NOT needed. 90% Of the good modded servers aren't even using the DLC.\nSo to all the people who are taking away there Recommendation or thumbing it down just because of that, Your stupid.\n\nHere is a summary: (Both pro's and con's)\n\nPRO'S:\n- Alot of things to do.\n- Loads of different dinos to tame.\n- Amazing Visuals\n- Great gameplay mechanics\n- Thousands of great mods for you to try.\n- Constantly Updated; Adding new items, mechanics and dinos - All of which are free for all.\n- Possibly the best open world survival game to date.\n- Tons of craftables\n- Great buildings - You can make great looking bases or rubbish looking ones. Take your pick ;)\n- Raiding is AMAZING,\n\nCON'S:\n- Terrible optimization; Game struggles to maintain 60fps on High settings (Anyone who tells you they can get constant 60+fps on Epic settings is full of sh*t, The new titan X can't even do it at 1080p)\n- Full of bugs; None of which are game breaking (For me at least) But they can get very annoying. - Agian, they aren't big bugs, but annoying little ones that are sometimes hard to fix.\n- Can be a grind.\n- Most people who play official servers are NOT social. You WILL be killed on sight 90% of the time. \n- You need pretty high end specs to get the game into the 'Playable' range (Even on lower settings) - Personally, I can deal with it.\n\nNEUTRAL:\n- The paid 'Scorched Earth' DLC - While most people don't care (as it isn't forced and you DON'T need it) there are alot of butthurt people who get angry about it for no reason; Hence why I put it under 'Neutral' - Most don't care, But some do.\n\nThere we go,\nAs of right now, I give the game an overall score of 8 / 10.\nOnce Ironed out it can definantly be a 9 / 10 - a 10 / 10 (In my opinion)\nDespite what others think (Due to he paid DLC, that some butthurt people don't agree with)\nI still HIGHLY reccomend ARK: Survival Evolved.\n\n: NOTE :\n- Only but this game if you have, atleast, a mid -

That is how you can enjoy this game and thrive as a community. Everyone who join official servers think that those are the best, but to be honest those were developed just in case no one started their own ark servers, so they were not well made. However, since players made their own servers, these were made to run smoothly, and have minimal issues.

Neon blue? For a survival game? Really?\nBuilding is just confusing as all hell, ladders are really hard to put down correctly. Just get a blueprint all-in-one like Rust has.. Much less confusing.\nThe game is insanely hard to get into without any help from friends. I was completely lost and even on a ~10 person server I was still getting spawnkilled by compies or whatever they're called, no matter where I spawned. (This is on a server with reduced dino spawning, x2 resources and x2.5 leveling!)\n\nIt's just a clunky mess, for half the price just get Rust!\nAnd no, I didn't get this game expecting it to be Rust with dragons or whatever, got it because it was apparently a good survival game to play with friends, which it isn't. Thank god I got it on G2A instead of full price.\nDon't make the mistake I did. Rust was 3$ on HumbleBundle at the same time I bought this trash game, for about 26$ (canadian) less, I could've bought 2 of my friends a copy of rust.\n\n4/10, ok-ish graphics and riding dinos (that my friends had to give me because I just kept dying..) are the only things worth anything in this game.\nDon't get this game unless you've got a group of people ready to start up with you, thought going solo in Rust was hard?

Let PVE be PVE, and let PVP change constantly with the inevitable nerfs that resolve exploits. And so we come to the April Fool's update. How appropriate, because it is a joke, indeed.

Here are some reasons why\n1,Grinding: there is too much grinding in the game. Getting any kind of base started is going to take alot of time and resources, especially since you have very limited carrying wheight.\n2. spawning. The dinosaur spawning is not very great. In the swamps, for example, they will just spawn in clumps of random dinosaurs, whether they be hostile are not. Its just not realistic having a bunch of 5-8 or more dinosaurs spawning around eachother. It looks more like a chaotic warfield than anything. It is especially frustrating having brontosaurus spawn near your base, all it takes is one accidential hit or an attack by a carnivore and you can kiss your base (and most likely your dinosaurs) goodye.\n3. brontosaurus and other large longneck dinosaurs. They are too glitchy. they can hit you from pretty far away with their tail that has a larger than fair hitrange. They can pretty much take anything down or destroy your base within seconds.\n4.Exsploration and death. The game has a very large sized game map that is very beautiful, but traveling is not possible since the bad dinosaur spawning will make a barrier to keep you from exsploring. the only way to exsplore is with a flying creature. dying to is just a horrible system. when you die you lose all the items you had. theres no option to make it possible to retrieve them, which games like & days to die and Minecraft do have. There is also no way to locate your body easily. Back to grinding to get the items you once had so you can go lose them again. The death just takes away any reason or fun from exsploring.\n5.Graphics. The graphics arent bad, its just your going to need a beefy computer to handle it. It might also be difficult to get things just right for people who arent tech savy, since the graphics menu has a ton of options to change ( which some may enjoy, but others not)\n6. Some recipes in game just dont make much sense. Maybe its just me.\n\nNow, to be fair, it does seem like a fun game. I just dont recommend playing it unless you play with friends and you are someone who can dedicate time to playing through the grinding, because this is definiately not an hour a day game. your not going to get anything done", "upvoted": false, "time_of_review_unix": 1491438078.0, "minutes_played": 998, "upvotes_window": 687, "total_window": 1893, "percent_window": 0.3629160063391442, "neu_sent": 0.756, "neg_sent": 0.148, "pos_sent": 0.096, "comp_sent": -0.9752, "neu_window": 0.7060316789862731, "neg_window": 0.1195079197465682, "pos_window": 0.1723579725448784, "comp_window": 0.12690047518479408, "percent_window_roc": 0.5949615326595262, "neu_window_roc": 0.900337046914889, "neg_window_roc": 0.8949596470055815, "pos_window_roc": 0.6496988358054785, "comp_window_roc": 0.4505918968487745, "1day_forecast": 0.002587073742991275, "1day_delta": -0.0032344361387318665, "classification": 0.0, "neg_predict": 0.08671741410254794, "pos_predict": 0.02211330494157735}, {"time_of_review": "2017-04-07T00:31:46", "review": "it's a great game, lot to do,", "upvoted": true, "time_of_review_unix": 1491525106.0, "minutes_played": 76926, "upvotes_window": 713, "total_window": 1949, "percent_window": 0.36582863006670086, "neu_sent": 0.549, "neg_sent": 0.0, "pos_sent": 0.451, "comp_sent": 0.6249, "neu_window": 0.7055846153846153, "neg_window": 0.11855487179487198, "pos_window": 0.1727902564102564, "comp_window": 0.13208687179487177, "percent_window_roc": 0.5837362637362637, "neu_window_roc": 0.9028866360298363, "neg_window_roc": 0.9042032967032967, "pos_window_roc": 0.6422238197939133, "comp_window_roc": 0.43765182186234813, "1day_forecast": 0.003224950303855001, "1day_delta": 0.0027679440508697195, "classification": 0.0, "neg_predict": 0.05121239174435542, "pos_predict": 0.03060686845890346}, {"time_of_review": "2017-04-08T00:02:22", "review": "ARK: Survival Evolved - 0%", "upvoted": false, "time_of_review_unix": 1491609742.0, "minutes_played": 553, "upvotes_window": 736, "total_window": 1997, "percent_window": 0.3685528292438658, "neu_sent": 1.0, "neg_sent": 0.0, "pos_sent": 0.0, "comp_sent": 0.0, "neu_window": 0.7037077077077071, "neg_window": 0.11729729729729749, "pos_window": 0.17599649649649654, "comp_window": 0.13807007007007022, "percent_window_roc": 0.5725725725725725, "neu_window_roc": 0.904298173886886, "neg_window_roc": 0.9123230373230373, "pos_window_roc": 0.6345909772701049, "comp_window_roc": 0.425118100556697, "1day_forecast": -0.0011155444430787642, "1day_delta": 0.002724199177164932, "classification": 0.0, "neg_predict": 0.03153742752814443, "pos_predict": 0.0450844327638462}, {"time_of_review": "2017-04-09T00:11:09", "review": "it is bad", "upvoted": false, "time_of_review_unix": 1491696669.0, "minutes_played": 1506, "upvotes_window": 745, "total_window": 2030, "percent_window": 0.3669950738916256, "neu_sent": 0.364, "neg_sent": 0.636, "pos_sent": 0.0, "comp_sent": -0.5423, "neu_window": 0.7068202855736083, "neg_window": 0.11698375184638124, "pos_window": 0.17324618414574094, "comp_window": 0.13095376661743, "percent_window_roc": 0.5610184989800943, "neu_window_roc": 0.9064880128054188, "neg_window_roc": 0.9226630090736442, "pos_window_roc": 0.627347760797974, "comp_window_roc": 0.41324384323684643, "1day_forecast": 0.005109173212621498, "1day_delta": -0.0020585064789302443, "classification": 0.0, "neg_predict": 0.021650277324512558, "pos_predict": 0.05689750218531862}, {"time_of_review": "2017-04-10T00:16:18", "review": "I've owned this game since June 2015 & have never been able to play it.

The concept of an open world survival game with dinosaurs and other prehistoric creatures was taken straight out of my dream bucket, so naturally I was immediately on board for it. I purchased my copy of Ark sometime nearly 2 years ago. Previously my only gaming PC was a crappy laptop with a low end NVIDIA card which was not recommended to run this game. I was aware of this before purchasing, and proceeded to play the game anyway. I spent 250 hours playing Ark with lowest settings and claylike graphics at around a consistent rate of 12 FPS, and even then for me personally it was absolutely worth it. After that I was out of the game for about 10 months while saving up for a new gaming rig. When I returned to ark many updates later, all of the quality and replay value were still there with even more to offer. I'm now going on 350 hours into the game with a steady rate of 150 FPS on my new GTX 1070, and the enhanced graphics and playability has greatly increased compared to my previous experience with ark (which I still consider to be a positive one.) The core gameplay for ark itself maintains a very high replay value even as the game is in its current state. I can see myself coming back to play Ark again and again, and enjoying every phase of the game from beach goer to tek tier for many years to come. However - the reviews for this game are true, and it is horribly unoptimised for low to mid tier systems. If you do not have a very powerful gaming PC, I would not suggest purchasing the game, or at least only purchasing it on sale until at some point in the future when the game is further optimised. Alternatively, if you do have a high end system, and you like dinosurs and survival games, or you want a totally customizable game to get addicted to and lose thousands of hours playing, I can highly suggest you invest in Ark. Because of the core dynamics of the game, I can see a very open and ambitious future for Ark as it is now, and as a franchise for future installments. Depending on the type of server you play, you really can customize your Ark experience to be whatever you want it to be. This has the potential to attract a greater diversity of players. Whether you favor single player, multiplayer, PVE or PVP or something in between, there will be a server type and a play type out there for you and your tastes. If you are intending to start playing the game for the first time, I wouldn't recommend anything other than doing your research first. Find out what play style suits you and become aware of the different server types, current game status, and game dynamics before you purchase.

Died 10mins away from the nearest bed while you were in the dark? sucks to be you as you run across the map buttnaked away from dinos that are pretty awesomely fast just to get to around the spot you died so you can search with a torch out for a small bag that doesn't stick out well. having this feature in the game pretty much requires people to sit there and put roughly 20-28ish different points in speed to get around 150% running speed so they don't even get touched by crazy fast dinos while running towards the nearest pile of their junk which is likely surrounded by dinos.\n\nSwitching into an offical server wearing your gear - Now, i like this feature actually because of how much it helps to move bases or tribes to another server, or allows your tribe to tame a cool dlc dino, but there are some points with this feature that are ridicious. certain DLC dinos are rather too strong to sit there and have people bring them back to torment normal players which simply have the base game, another failure of the server switching with gear, is that if a strong tribe gets enough people and materials together, which isn't difficult for a strong tribe, they can basically go around RPG'ing the crud out of low level bases on any server. Nothing is more frusterating then having some kid apart of some large tribe come randomly onto your server, rpg your small base and then run off back to whatever server he might have come from in the first place, basically being raid immune and unpunished for offline raiding a small players base. I think a decent change for this is holding gear in suspention for a day before allowing it to be transfered to another server, to make tribes think more about moving and to help against people quick raiding.\n\nDino spawn - it might seem strange, but i don't mind how difficult it can be to get started on ark sometimes in a dangerous area, but one thing that annoys me to no end is how frequent i see certain spawns within a small area without any time inbetween. You sit there and kill a pack of troodons that have been sitting outside your base for the last 2 days, and they're back to sitting outside your base within the next hour or two. i want clearing the area outside my base of dangerous things to mean more then a calm for the next hour, why cant they spawn slightly down the hill this time and wander off to somewhere that isn't the outside of my hut, so i don't have to see them back around my house a simple hour after i killed them.\n\npvp structures - it's a rather large annoyance to have some high level totally destory your base because \"lul my tribe owns this server\" i feel like structure protection/immunity for the first day you put it down should be a thing to help young/small tribes get their foothold on a server without being shoved off by larger tribes. why? because currently in this game, any tribe that has held a good/decent spot on the map has the power to instantly wipe out any freshly made base for no other reason then to try and scare the small tribe off the server. the power difference of 10 levels is huge, but we're talking about 20-50 level difference tribes that have sat at a decent part of the map for over a month or two. getting totally destoryed, everytime some young tribe trys to setup on a server that happens to have a extremely hostile larger tribe is just something that isn't fun, something that shouldn't be apart of this game.\n\nNo Server wipes - this is a big thing, basically it gets to the point that there are deserted servers because of large tribes that came, built everywhere, claimed everything important, put auto turrets everywhere in mass on every important spot, claimed all metal nodes/obsidian/crystal/beaver dams/ect and because the pvp structure decay is either bugged or doesn't always work, you have massive servers that are just totally empty due to normal players just not able to build in decent spots or any spot for that matter where they can safely get metal or important resorces without being attacked by 20ish auto turrets by extremely large tribes. there needs to be server wipes, there needs to be the requirement for players to climb again to be the top tribe on the server in order for pvp to even be a thing. as of the moment, the game's pvp is super unhealthy\n\nall & all, there are several things that are rather poorly thought out, but honestly just removing the frusteration with the game would help out 100x better then drastically changing these features.\n\nArk is super fun, enjoyable alone or with friends, pve or pvp, definitely worth the buy just to \"accidently\" stab your friend with a pike trying to save them from a huge dragonfly.", "upvoted": false, "time_of_review_unix": 1493856170.0, "minutes_played": 78091, "upvotes_window": 422, "total_window": 665, "percent_window": 0.6345864661654136, "neu_sent": 0.781, "neg_sent": 0.087, "pos_sent": 0.133, "comp_sent": 0.9937, "neu_window": 0.6797567567567561, "neg_window": 0.09516516516516513, "pos_window": 0.2220975975975975, "comp_window": 0.3010878378378378, "percent_window_roc": 0.7104247104247104, "neu_window_roc": 0.8891165257121426, "neg_window_roc": 0.8313223938223937, "pos_window_roc": 0.6922810661128418, "comp_window_roc": 0.5937516463832252, "1day_forecast": -0.0074936198944851595, "1day_delta": -0.002594943129938687, "classification": 0.0, "neg_predict": 0.004978577774474577, "pos_predict": 0.04148116710216418}, {"time_of_review": "2017-05-05T00:16:49", "review": "Ark is a great game. Dont let all these people complaining about the flying nerf get to you. Flyers had it coming from how over powered they were. On most raids, people only bring flyers because they were so powerful and could carry so much. This nerf was good and was able to make some of the land dinos have a purpose again for PVP. Besides that, this was one of the best games I've ever played with active developers and amazing graphics. However, in order to run this game well I recommend getting a nice graphics card because the game can be difficult to run on good graphics. The game can be optimized by the player to make it run better by setting the graphics low and other methods.

I read about how people are crying about alpha tribes and that devs are bloating the game, but compared to two years ago when it launched the game has come a LONG way and is becoming polished, and better rounded, with more stuff to do and achieve. I really think the game gets bad reviews because it is really complex, and has a steep learning curve, but that is what makes it fun. \n\nI saw someone post about being punished for not playing 24/7, which is woefully inaccurate. The game has many many many servers available, some of them damn near empty, or it has a solid single player that removes the rival tribe challenge but ads extra difficulty in doing the thing on your own (which is very satisfying), or hey, how about a private server?

After my boyfriend took a couple hours to set up the server we all started playing together, and it was wonderful. Starting out on the beach with nothing and just gradually working your way up was such a fun experience. At first we were constantly in danger, always having to watch our backs, but once we created our huts we finally found some safety. But there was always that element of danger when we played and it made the game exciting. Every time I ventured inland in search of resources or dinos I felt on edge. I would be terrified of losing the dinos I had or the gear I took and I loved every second of it. The first time I went to the center I couldn't leave my boat because I was so terrified of all of the caros and raptors I saw lurking around the beach. And the first time I lost my raft to a leed was amazing because it was just a reminder of the constant danger of the world.\n\nBut all of that goes away once you advance high enough up the tech tree. Eventually you get to a point where you don't have to worry about any of the dinos you run into. By taming Argents you're able to fly all across the map without ever being challenged, and the large carry weight means you can just bring a couple and mine all the material you want and head back to your base. The challenge goes away. Guns one shot a ton of creatures and flak armor makes it so you can fight most wild dinos in a melee fight. My boyfriend was able to kill an alpha raptor on foot with a pike and flak armor by just running around it and hitting it in its blind spot. Eventually it just gets to the point where you're grinding and taming dinos for no real reason since flak armor and longnecks are all you basically need to become immortal in this game.\n\nSo after about a week we got bored of PvE, but there was still so much to explore and do. So we decided to play PvP to try and get the challenge back. The only problem is that there is no challenge in PvP, it's impossible to play and you'll just frustrate yourself if you try. Basically every server has a massive alpha tribe who owns a server, and they go on wipes to make sure that no one else rises up and challenges them. Imagine spending an entire day scouting out a hidden base location and grinding out resources in order to build it and than just having some hacker come along and esp it in the bushes. Hackers aside, the way the game is set up is designed to keep alphas on top and new players on the bottom. All the new stuff that is being added doesn't benefit new players because alpha tribes will never let you obtain them. They block off caves and put auto turrets there so that no one can go down there and get good gear, they place metal foundations in areas that have easy access to metal and crystal so that they don't respawn and other players can't use them. And even if you are somehow able to build a base, it's impossible for you to protect it. I had built a huge fortress with a ton of tames in it that me and my small tribe got that day. When we all logged of that night the alphas on the server  came and destroyed it all. By using the website Battlemetrics, they're able to get alerts sent to their phones when a specific player logs off or onto the server, meaning that they always know if you're online or offline. And because of this they will never attack you when you're online because it makes it a little bit harder for them (even though all their dinos and gear are 3x better than anything a new player can get). And the game is designed so that literally anyone with enough explosives and time can destroy your base (unless you're an alpha in which case you have an indestructible fortress with hundreds of auto turrets and thousands of plant x). There's no defense against this which means you're always vulnerable, even if you have a metal base with a ton of guard dinos.\n\nThe devs just seem content to let their game die, every update they put out makes the game a little bit worse. Server transfers were the start of this game dying off. Anyone can transfer onto any server and bring any items they want, which means that alpha tribes can just raid on another server and than leave. Processes like breeding are impossible for a single player to do, if you don't log on for one day during the two week process than your breed dies. If you're not constantly watching over it and making sure it's feed, it will die. This means if you're a normal person and have work or school, than this is something that isn't possible for you to do. Large tribes have giant breeding rooms full of air conditioners and tribe members to feed them so this isn't a problem for them. And the biggest issue with this is that breed dinos can reach a much higher level than wild tames. So anytime you face up against an alpha tribes dinos its always going to be better. And now the devs have added a tek cloning chamber, which is also impossible for small tribes to get because the only way to beat bosses in this game is to tame multiple high level rexes and attack it at the same time. It takes 0 skill to do, all it takes is someone who has a ton of tribe members who do whatever he says. So people saying you need to get better at PvP haven't realized that it takes literally 0 skill to be an alpha. All it takes it tribe members and resources and you can overthrow anyone if you have the time.\n\nMy last point is that the game literally punishes you for not playing 24/7. Dinos have to be fed often or they'll die. I had a high level argent that I tamed and it died the next day because I forgot to put food in it's inventory.  That wouldn't be a huge issue but food spoils, so if you go on vacation for a week and you're not playing ark the whole time then all of your tames will die. And if you're not online around the clock than someone will come along and destroy your base. And not to mention all the grinding this game makes you do. This game might as well be called Farming Simulator 2017 because that's what you spend the majority of your time doing. And than when you log off that night someone comes along and steals everything you farmed. If you want to try and go raiding you have to spend the whole day farming materials and at the end of the day you get 40 C4. Meanwhile alpha tribes can get hundreds of C4 within an hour due to all their members, tames, and the exploits they use. \n\nAnyways I'm done with this review.

But after seeing all this negativity because of the price tag, I had to stand up for the creators of this game.\n\nNow sit down kid, I'm going to tell you a story and it won't be brief.\n\nI had ark, at the first week of its release, at that point, I was playing Reign of Kings. I'm pretty much of a decent builder so people used to rent me for building castles etc. At the release of ark to public, most of my friends flocked to it, I was never into dinosaurs, I really didn't like the concept. After getting bored in my half dead server, I had to give it a go and had it.\n\nMy first attempt on game was, trying to build a thatch house of 1x1. I'm pretty much of a passive player, I simply can't pvp. I got shrekt at minute one by dangling naked people. It was so early that every server was x1 gather rate. Game was HARD. Everything was hard. Getting a flying animal was most likely to be impossible. I loved it. It was pure survival. The randomness of it charmed me. Nothing was static like we see in other games, everything was on prowl, moving, the map was ALIVE. When you see something, you knew that in a blink of an eye, it could be taken or killed by others. Building was expensive, and it required a teamwork. Gathering metal was impossible for a passive player, you had to get into a cave or climb an equally dangerous mountain. I chose cave because i was pretty much of a retard. The first time Ive seen the giant snake, screamed like a girl with my friend. It was pretty much one of the best moments I had in any game. Game was exciting, frightening and full of suprises. It was hard on my machine, so I could only afford medium low settings for a 30-40 fps with my gtx670M, which was better than other games of the same genre. \n\nAfter a while of constant struggle, frustration of dying and losing everything, we have seen that unofficial servers had the ability to increase the gather rates. So we joined a x5 server, it was even better. Metal was still impossible for me and for my loser friends. But wood was good enough. Taming hours were insanely high, but you felt like you achieved something in return. Everything was functional. Everything you invest in ark was a help in return, Ive never seen that in any other game. They were mostly dropping bad loots. Taming, riding, these were exceptionally good. \n\nThe ERA of MODDING, now this is where everything started to become, BETTER. Ark was very strong on modding side and still is. But the introduction of mods, and the quality of the modders (Hey every modder, I love you all) this game \"transcended\" into another dimension of gaming. We had everything, they made flyer tame and metal gather easier, after that Ive become admin in various servers since my builds were highly commended. Ive seen that the game had so much to offer. The building system of this game is UNIQUE. Ive played pretty much every game with building option in it. I've never had the opportunity to be so versatile and so independant of rules at buildng in any other game. Ive built pyramids, giant castles, trade ports, cities, battleships, towers, cathedrals, science bases, island bases, sky bases, underwater bases all with unique and different look EVERY SINGLE TIME. Now this is something, that I would pay with everything I had. It tought me alot. \n\nPretty much later, game had its first dlc, as scorching earth. It had some bad reviews because of the weirdo money hoarder people who cannot appreciate a good game when they see it. Although I was having so much fun, I didnt even blink while buying it. And voila, its ark in a whole new perspective, I felt like I returned back to vanilla in a much harsher and cruel way, it was amazing. It worth every penny I gave. Dragons, Giants, Sandstorms, struggle for water. What a DLC it was, full of content. Thats a DLC you would like when you are paying for it. It wasn't some skins or something that was taken away from vanilla game just to be sold. It was ARK in a different level. \n\nThan we ve seen The Center map. Man. Which other game actually took a mod, and made it official with paying for it. I've never seen such a good development strategy, executed this well. The center was okay, It was free. I just couldnt find some good spots for my taste to build so I stuck with my vanilla island map or the scorched earth in that matter.\n\nFinally reaching to the end, now we have this uncountable amount of mods, paid mods, official mods like primitive+ and everything ark has become a sandbox that you can do WHATEVER you want. If youd dont like an aspect of it, you can remove it, or you can add if you want anything. This game is the ultimate sandbox, and the developpers should be commended for their effort of patching pretty much EVERYSINGLE DAY.\n\nThis game had so many patches for bugs and content that as an admin I was pretty sick of patching my server everyday. People were sick that the game was getting patched this fast. Have you ever heard it in any other company before? I did not. And it was not patches of 1 or two, every patch was a patch that we asked for. I cannot even keep the track of dinos we have in game. Probably most of the games in web dont even have this many unique characters in whole singleplayer campaign of theirs and this game is online. \n\nIn the end,\nTo my fellow ark players who comment negative for price tag.\n-I've seen most of you had below 1000 hours. Below 1000 hours, you cannot assume that you totally explored this game, therefore your review is pretty much trolley at this point. \n-Recognize that this game had the greatest of developments of our last 5 years in gaming history. This game was a baby and it has matured in front of our eyes. We should be greatful that we have such dedicated development who worked day and night to fix problems, add content and listen to our nonesense. \n-If you already have the game, why are you complaining about it's price?\n-If you do not have the game, why did you not buy it 1 week ago at a VERY low price in steamsale, or any other sale before that. This game was forever in sale. \n-Think twice before who you are going to discourage while we have developpers like EA, Bioware, Ubisoft who delivers unfinished games with no mod support and incompetent community assist. \n-This game is more AAA than any other AAA games we ever had. It may not be supported by a large benefactor, but it doesnt define how good this game has become after the proper amount of development time.\n\nTo my beloved newcomers and people who are willing to buy ARK,\n-As Ive mentioned above in my small story, this game has the potential to become whatever you want. \n-You can build anything\n-You can tame anything, and ride it with few exceptions(yeah I wanted to ride the snek aswell)\n-Game has aerial, ground and naval perspective.\n-You don't like to be skrewed like me in pvp? go PVE or RP, game has alot of mods that allows people to enjoy it.\n-You dont like guns and tech, go for primitive+ mod.\n-You dont like dinos? Disable taming them and let people struggle with puny guns and spears.\n-Whatever you do not like, can be disabled, can be removed, or can be altered.\n-Whatever you like can be modded, added, enabled. From new creatures to new buildings, from non existant skills (yes there is a mod that allows you to bend elements like avatar) to guns weapons armor, maps play styles air conditions. \n\nThis game, deserves the price tag it had and it deserves whatever price tag it may have. If you dont like the game, do not play it that's okay, but in my opinion, buy it, so you can encourage these kind and hard working developpers to feel like they made the right thing. Or just persuade the other incompetent half job developpers in other companies (mostly AAA ones) to see that, hardwork and attention wins more than milking series. \n\nARK, you will always be my beloved.", "upvoted": true, "time_of_review_unix": 1499558405.0, "minutes_played": 105987, "upvotes_window": 1323, "total_window": 2647, "percent_window": 0.49981110691348696, "neu_sent": 0.743, "neg_sent": 0.117, "pos_sent": 0.14, "comp_sent": 0.994, "neu_window": 0.678832703927491, "neg_window": 0.09881268882175231, "pos_window": 0.21782024169184286, "comp_window": 0.25088104229607344, "percent_window_roc": 0.7423392317652137, "neu_window_roc": 0.8665983106603626, "neg_window_roc": 0.7366273737591713, "pos_window_roc": 0.778816199376947, "comp_window_roc": 0.630863412307203, "1day_forecast": -0.026071611115167648, "1day_delta": -0.0468210174388447, "classification": 0.0, "neg_predict": 0.6724033951249595, "pos_predict": 0.0033755996146502564}, {"time_of_review": "2017-07-10T00:05:37", "review": "happy I got it before the price change boy\n\nThis game is really fun!

I think you guys got enough money with 30$, I mean the game is huge, but double it? It seems kind of crazy. \n\nOther than the price change, I think this game is very good and usually fun!

It is a great game that has given me huge enjoyment, and I have gotten much more than I originally payed for it in enjoyment. The server community is toxic, but renting servers for friends is cheap and the game runs fairly well for what it is. I rented my own server for $15 a month, and played with 3 of my friends and we enjoyed all of it. we set rates so they weren't as grindy and the game was still difficult, but it was fun. \n\nIt is a good game, Its fun and doesn't get old. You MUST play on a private/non-official server if you dont want to devote your life. OPTIMIZATION!!! I can barely run at medium graphics and i have a GTX 760, I know it isn't the newest card, but I can play most games at near-max settings at 30-40 FPS, however I struggle to stay above 35 at medium in this game. \nThe one thing that will make me change the review is how it runs, it runs terribly and the graphics aren't amazing enough to warrant low FPS, I play Rust which is also an alpha game on ultra settings and hover around 30 FPS without issues. (Im comparing to rust because it is also an early access game in development) Rust also doesnt eat 6 gigs of ram by itself. Buy the game if it is on sale, it has alot of potential.

Now this said, i used to play on console and that is whats garbage. console you cant even raid a big base without half the server dc'ing, then you log back in dead and someone stole your gear, and the second you figure out youve been looted you get kicked off the server again. This game shouldnt be made for xbox one or ps4 they even said the console that should used to play ark is the new xbox scorpio or whatever, thats not even out yet. They need to forget console and if console players dont like it whatever there shits outdated anyways and should just get a pc if they wonna be able to play big games like this. All the time they put into the console versions could of went to the pc and actualy made things better and optimize it so a more wide range of pc's can run the game properly instead of trying to dial in console verisons when they know the xbox isnt stronge enough for what they want the game to be. If you have a Decent Pc id recommend the game. it has alot of playback value. and is pretty fun if you are a solo player there is still fun to be had but its alot harder. so id recommend having someone to play with.

I run our server and have little trouble considering its early access, yes I had to purchase a better graphics card but I think it worth it cause no other game ive seen has this much going on. The extra content being released has only enhanced the gameplay and stopped boredom setting in so perhaps other game makers should follow suit.

The idea is great, however, execution is horrible. Be ready for weeks of grinding to build any of the more advanced items/base, logging in on daily basis or more often to keep things running (feed dinos, water plants, fix minor damage to the base)... All until you get raided and need to start over. And oh, btw, once you do get raided forget about rebuilding your base and regaining the little bit of power you had. It won't happen. Whoever did destroy your base and killed your dinos (which btw is super fast and easy) won't let you rebuild your base. No matter if you play solo or in a large group. Chances are null.\n\nSo, you might be thinking, another frustrated noob player. Then think about it from the winner perspective. Your group (you don't stand a chance solo), your group owns most advanced base and strongest dinos. Possibly all the strongest dinos so that your enemies can't be a match for you. You control access to all most advanced resources (so that your enemies can't be a match for you). You enjoy raiding whoever builds up a little bit. But you still keep everyone in check, not letting them to develop too much. Where is the fun playing a game where no one stands a chance against you? And you don't want anyone to develop a little too much. Why? One bad day, most of your group can't login, someone raids your base and you're done. Oh, and keep in mind you still need to login on daily basis to keep things running. Running = your base having all resources to keep running (yeah, grind, grind, grind) and checking on all opponents basis, raiding them if needed. Not fun. I don't know which side is more miserable.\n\nIn short, this game needs some very serious rebalancing to be fun to play. You'll enjoy first few days, maybe a week and then you'll just hate it. Not because of how badly you will be beaten. Because you will know how super fun this game could be, and why in the current state it can not.", "upvoted": false, "time_of_review_unix": 1502928354.0, "minutes_played": 24704, "upvotes_window": 516, "total_window": 1013, "percent_window": 0.5093780848963475, "neu_sent": 0.724, "neg_sent": 0.129, "pos_sent": 0.146, "comp_sent": 0.7977, "neu_window": 0.6884861932938849, "neg_window": 0.09949999999999999, "pos_window": 0.2080542406311637, "comp_window": 0.28161568047337265, "percent_window_roc": 0.5353620738236123, "neu_window_roc": 0.8987246693987567, "neg_window_roc": 0.8904268808114962, "pos_window_roc": 0.6451731829158142, "comp_window_roc": 0.5093601854735458, "1day_forecast": 0.006653979231909024, "1day_delta": 0.008391891602461898, "classification": 0.0, "neg_predict": 0.0004329329723049851, "pos_predict": 0.23901738550867002}, {"time_of_review": "2017-08-18T00:25:44", "review": "Bought this for my iMac, meets requirements, so buggy i can't get past the menus.", "upvoted": false, "time_of_review_unix": 1503015944.0, "minutes_played": 342, "upvotes_window": 515, "total_window": 998, "percent_window": 0.5160320641282565, "neu_sent": 1.0, "neg_sent": 0.0, "pos_sent": 0.0, "comp_sent": 0.0, "neu_window": 0.6860960960960959, "neg_window": 0.10153853853853845, "pos_window": 0.20834434434434432, "comp_window": 0.2790518518518519, "percent_window_roc": 0.53996853996854, "neu_window_roc": 0.8990176006087144, "neg_window_roc": 0.8867438867438867, "pos_window_roc": 0.6455053184025146, "comp_window_roc": 0.5149886728834098, "1day_forecast": 0.004050325161135904, "1day_delta": 0.00764114606310351, "classification": 0.0, "neg_predict": 0.00048750832822660496, "pos_predict": 0.23716093728319915}, {"time_of_review": "2017-08-19T00:19:59", "review": "Good Concept, however it seems they are focused more on adding broken content then fixing what they have.

An arbitrary $30 price hike for no reason? Paid DLC for an unfinished main product? This is a perfect example of coprorate greed. If you're stumbling upon this game now, then I'm sorry...you missed the boat. What once had a lot of promise has been reduced to last ditch effort of a money grab. If you're reading this, do NOT buy this game. A message has to be sent to these developers that if they have shady businesses practices, then it WILL affect their sales. Purchasing this game will only vindicate and validate their actions...\n\nArk: Survival Evolved is like the video game equivalent to dating a model. Beautiful, exciting. There's some drama at first...a little high maintenance. But hey, you're dating a model. Just think what your friends will think! You propose marriage, and she accepts, despite not being satisfied with the size of the ring. You go where SHE wants to go on the honeymoon. You buy the house SHE wants to buy. Then the novelty of being married to a model starts to wear off...She starts to blow all of your money on Gucci shoes and Louis Vuitton purses. She starts to put on weight. She begins to make outrages claims, like she \"invented the question mark\". You continue to put up with her crap, despite her being an overweight, dramatic, bossy leach. And then one day she leaves you...broke, frustrated, angry, and 450 hours that you'll never get back poorer. \n\n\n------------------------------------------------------PRIOR REVIEW------------------------------------------------\nI want to recommend this game so bad. I really do...But, it's intolerable. It will push you to the brink of frustration, and not for the right reasons. I've played over 60 hours, and probably another 60 on my friends account.\n\nI can deal with the optimization problems. It's in early access. They're working hard on it. I can be patient with that...\nI can deal with bugs, and falling through the world, drowning in a bottomless ocean as my newly tamed Carno dies...\nI can deal with taming a new Dino for hours, only to disconnect and have him eaten while logging back in...\nI can deal with my body (full of awesome gear and materials) bugging out, and not letting me retrieve my stuff...\nI can deal with all of that. It's tolerable. I love the challenge an unforgiving game poses. \n\nWhat I can't deal with, and which is why I'm writing this review, is the fact that this persistent world is literally a griefers paradise. Literally days of hard work and frustration (although satisfying frustration) will, not can, will be flushed down the drain...it's an innevitability. Once your base is discovered, you're done. That Bronto that took you 4 hours to tame? Gone. Those Raptors you loved and nurtured since lvl 1? Dead. Those Pterasaurs you painstakingly nursed back to life, and love soaring the island of Ark? Hopefully they booked it at the first sign of trouble. \n\nYes, everything you've worked hard for can and will be destroyed, killed, and looted...while you're sleeping ever so peacefully in your bed. It's not fun. It's a great idea. Kudos to the developers for such an awesome game, and so many great ideas...but it simply doesn't work this way. People are jerks. People ruin good ideas. People ruin everything. It's why rainforests have to be preserved, and beautiful paintings have to be locked away behind glass. \n\nYes, the first few days, you'll laugh it off. You'll shrug, and think \"Man, this game is unforgiving...but it's awesome! I'll keep leveling up, and getting better!\" You'll feel the highs of accomplishment. You'll feel on top. You'll feel motivated, and set goals...And you WILL be utterly disappointed.\n\nPlease fix this game. It's so close to being one of the best games I've ever played...I just can't recommend this game to anyone with a clean conscience.\n\n\n-----------------------------------------UPDATE------------------------------------------\n\n\nI told myself I wasn't going to reply to any of these comments, for obvious reasons, but I'll address my feelings on some of the common points being made.\n\n1) Go player Local/PVE server (insert offensive word here).\n\n-Unfortunately, that's what I've been doing. It's not nearly as fun as a PvP server, and I am having to downgrade my playing experience due to the issues mentioned in my Review. I happen to enjoy playing PvP, and like the idea of having to defend my dinosaurs and my base...but, in real time. Waking up after taming/building the entire day before, and seeing that everything has been destroyed/killed/looted while I was sleeping is not enjoyable. I'm not a masochist. I don't enjoy self-inflicted pain.\n\nMy review was intended to, as unlikely as it may be, prompt some kind of change to an aspect of the game that I don't enjoy. I paid the same price that all of you paid. I feel I shouldn't have to downgrade my playing experience, playing an aspect I don't enjoy as much. That's like, for example, I'm playing baseball but the pitcher keeps throwing the ball at my head while I'm batting...\"Uhm, hey! Can you please not throw the ball at my head? I want to bat\", and then the pitcher and the rest of the opposing team replies \"Shuttup noob. Go play T-Ball if you don't like it!\" \n\n2) But you're still playing the game! You're a hypocrite...\n\n- Again, I enjoy the game. I mentioned in my review how much I enjoyed the game. I like PVP much more than I like PVE (which I'm currently playing). I do not enjoy PVO (player vs Offline) at all, which is extremely prevalent in PVP servers. \n\n3) If you enjoy the game, why did you give it a negative review?\n\n- There's an old saying that goes \"the squeeky wheel gets the grease.\" That basically means, if we want to enact a change, we need to squeek a little. Unfortunately, there are only two options...Recommend or Not Recommend. If an individual were to read my review, and doesn't want to experience the same issues, then they would be able to save themselves $30. People often check Negative reviews for the, obviously, negative aspects of a game. You can only learn so much from a review about how great it is to be able to poop in the game...", "upvoted": false, "time_of_review_unix": 1503880437.0, "minutes_played": 32827, "upvotes_window": 477, "total_window": 995, "percent_window": 0.4793969849246231, "neu_sent": 0.776, "neg_sent": 0.078, "pos_sent": 0.146, "comp_sent": 0.9965, "neu_window": 0.701166666666667, "neg_window": 0.09843775100401604, "pos_window": 0.1973775100401606, "comp_window": 0.2602368473895581, "percent_window_roc": 0.5714285714285714, "neu_window_roc": 0.9109943225317965, "neg_window_roc": 0.8552065404475042, "pos_window_roc": 0.6318107320246719, "comp_window_roc": 0.5469245402663284, "1day_forecast": 0.004410669638674203, "1day_delta": -0.0007222993696114899, "classification": 0.0, "neg_predict": 0.005037837722128798, "pos_predict": 0.03688536730727988}, {"time_of_review": "2017-08-29T00:24:40", "review": "its an amazing game ignoring the price the game may be laggy but its so fun im speechless", "upvoted": true, "time_of_review_unix": 1503966280.0, "minutes_played": 18443, "upvotes_window": 494, "total_window": 1019, "percent_window": 0.4847890088321884, "neu_sent": 0.597, "neg_sent": 0.074, "pos_sent": 0.329, "comp_sent": 0.8132, "neu_window": 0.7019205882352942, "neg_window": 0.09615098039215693, "pos_window": 0.19897745098039205, "comp_window": 0.26515911764705885, "percent_window_roc": 0.5714285714285714, "neu_window_roc": 0.9128325121702839, "neg_window_roc": 0.8517857142857143, "pos_window_roc": 0.6291613218496122, "comp_window_roc": 0.5479016167870656, "1day_forecast": -0.04478900883218839, "1day_delta": 0.005392023907565269, "classification": 0.0, "neg_predict": 0.004750219991450083, "pos_predict": 0.038333670026084316}, {"time_of_review": "2017-08-30T00:00:08", "review": "Awesome game it plays well and it does not lag alot\n", "upvoted": true, "time_of_review_unix": 1504051208.0, "minutes_played": 25081, "upvotes_window": 670, "total_window": 1516, "percent_window": 0.4419525065963061, "neu_sent": 0.406, "neg_sent": 0.0, "pos_sent": 0.594, "comp_sent": 0.8495, "neu_window": 0.7004456163480544, "neg_window": 0.10671654581410682, "pos_window": 0.18953263019116676, "comp_window": 0.2500238628872776, "percent_window_roc": 0.5567379225915812, "neu_window_roc": 0.9171776209068168, "neg_window_roc": 0.8590851304265938, "pos_window_roc": 0.6201779623252156, "comp_window_roc": 0.5373023858261342, "1day_forecast": 0.008126109755895172, "1day_delta": -0.04283650223588231, "classification": 0.0, "neg_predict": 0.007224228731342381, "pos_predict": 0.02223232271165793}, {"time_of_review": "2017-08-31T00:00:24", "review": "im so glad its finally out i was getting tired of seeing the early acces thing every time i went to play it VERY fun game most likly more tek thing updates to come and btw new people i suggest u play single or small servers for now cuz big serves suffer from a thing called alpha tribes (they suck) but any ways HAVE FUN AND FORCE FEED THEM DODOS", "upvoted": true, "time_of_review_unix": 1504137624.0, "minutes_played": 15711, "upvotes_window": 1146, "total_window": 2545, "percent_window": 0.45029469548133594, "neu_sent": 0.764, "neg_sent": 0.055, "pos_sent": 0.181, "comp_sent": 0.8611, "neu_window": 0.6935188531029064, "neg_window": 0.10903849175176762, "pos_window": 0.19429183032207387, "comp_window": 0.24638263943440655, "percent_window_roc": 0.532824598810459, "neu_window_roc": 0.9178926426817704, "neg_window_roc": 0.8798886208057457, "pos_window_roc": 0.610572322842257, "comp_window_roc": 0.522215790851835, "1day_forecast": -0.013734852446672774, "1day_delta": 0.008633522112845515, "classification": 0.0, "neg_predict": 0.00294825577391337, "pos_predict": 0.0567275128982436}, {"time_of_review": "2017-09-01T00:07:52", "review": "This is a definite game to get when on sale the price boost has seemed to get a bunch of people upset regardless this is still an amazing game that is still coming out with new stuff and different maps and i was shocked when thay added the underwater exploration and if that was added I wouldnt be shocked if they added sky islands or other things that other games souly focus on.

The thing about Evolve, though, is that it was a mutiplayer game. It wasn't any fun alone. And as the developers released more paid DLC and \"season passes\" that didn't even unlock all the content, the player base started to drop. People like me that legitimately enjoyed the game just couldn't get behind the business practices of the publisher.\n\nARK's increase in price and release of a $45 \"season pass\" makes me feel like it's going the same way that Evolve did.

Its a great game to play if you can get a group of 4-5 friends together and find a good server.  \n\nPros:  \n\n-Hours of entertainment.  Days, weeks, MONTHS of entertainment.\n-Appropriate learning curve.  Feels challenging, but not dissuading or overwhelming.\n-Beautiful.  If you've got the right equipment, this game will take your breath away.\n-Original.  How many other games let you start with nothing, and build up to the point of riding a T-Rex with a gun?\n-Just plain cool.  You're going to enjoy this game.  Period.  For how long?  Idk, up to you.  But you will enjoy it.\n\n\nCons:\n-PVP is balanced towards those people who have no life.  If you can wait out the other person, you win.\n-Pretty low replay value, even with the endless mods.  Once you've done it all, you've done it all.  Takes like  1000+ hours though...\n-Official servers are a joke, don't even bother.  You have to find a private server, or you're gonna have a bad time.\n-Resource intensive.  This game is a hog.  If you don't have a proper rig, your experience is going to suffer.\n-Hard to find the \"perfect\" server.  Something will always be missing.  A mod you like, good connection... something is always absent.  You can't get everything you want, and if you do - the server shuts down after 2 weeks.  Only way to get everything perfectly the way you want it is to start (and pay for) your own server, and then good luck getting people to come play on it.\n-Most servers have absolutely ridiculous rates, like 1000x everything, which makes the game boring.\n-This is NOT a $60 game.

The kind that isn't shaven or trimmed in the slightest, is consistantly sweaty, and you KNOW hasn't been washed in at least a decade.  It looks pretty and when it's not lagging every 10 seconds, it is somewhat playable.  I spent at least an hour or 2 trying to solve the lagging.  Once I THOUGHT that was fixed I began to play a little until I died every 30 seconds and here's why.  The ABSOLUTE worst thing about this game is that when you spawn, 99.99999999999999% of the freaking time you spawn in another player's base.  THEN it tells you to get warm or DIE but even if you are fast enough to level up, learn how to build a campfire, gather all the necessary components to build said campfire, YOU F-ING BLOODY CAN'T DROP IT AND GET WARM BECAUSE YOU'RE SURROUNDED BY YOUR \"ENEMY\" BASES!!!!! Not to mention that half the time I did spawn, I was instantly eaten by some 100+ level creature from HELL! Oh but there's a fix to that! Just spend more money and get your own server! NOT WORTH IT.\n\nUPDATE:\n\nWith the release of Ragnarok, I'd thought I'd give this a second chance. WORST DECISION OF MY LIFE! After setting yourself up for success, YOU DIE! Then you're spending the next 4-5 hours building yourself back up again just so you can DIE AGAIN! Out of all the time I've put into this game, 99% of it was trying to get back to where I was in the game. If you value your time, money, happiness, sanity, and all around your life. DO NOT PURCHASE THIS GAME. I am now convinced that you must either have god-mode on OR put 50+ hours in WITHOUT DYING to even have the SLIGHTEST of chances at succeeding.

It takes up so much hard drive space compared to other games it's ridiculous. I had to uninstall the game simply because it could not fit on my hard drive anymore with the other games that I play. I also upgraded my graphics card to a 980Ti not that long ago simply to enjoy this game better... and it did nothing to help. The optimization in this game is horrible.  Sure, I could probably find a way to make it work on my computer. But with the other problems it has it wasn't worth it to try.\n\nNow, compared to other reviews I'm going to put this from the perspective of basically a single player. I never played online with others that weren't friends on a small private server, so that is where my time was spent. I went onto an official online server once with a friend back when the game started for ~1 hour, build a small base with them, and logged off for the night. When we came back all of our stuff was destroyed, our dinos killed, and our bodies ransacked for everything we had. Welp, so much for that.\n\nSo from a single player perspective I can certainly echo the time sink this game requires. Even with modified settings to make things go faster for us, most tames take over an hour to complete. Bases we wanted to build required thousands of mined resources which took us hours to do. We couldn't use the imprinting system because it would require way too much time... including setting alarms to wake us up in the middle of the night to play. Yes, these settings could be changed too, but when it was just us it wasn't worth messing with the archaic multiplier changing system. It requires going into the files of the game and changing numbers to what you want... some need to be bigger and some need to be made smaller to get faster and there is no set consistency. I think some people made 3rd party applications for your computer to give you a set of text to copy+paste in order to change them. And if that doesn't say how stupid it is, I'm not sure what will.\n\nAnd in the end...there was nothing for us to do. We couldn't delve the caves and unlock the bosses because there was no way for us to fight them with the stuff we had. We didn't want to PvP against each other and hate each other over a game. So once we built our base, nothing was left to do. Once we had the creatures we wanted with a base we were proud to have built (with the minor building things you CAN do, half of the ground you can't build on because the terrain isn't flat.) we were basically done.\n\nOne thing that bothers me a lot is that the devs don't seem to care all that much anymore. At the start of the game, they really listened to the community. If some game breaking bug appeared, it was fixed ASAP. New dinos, new structures, new... stuff was added when it was overwhemingly popular. Now it feels like we're being ignored. Not much they have added in the last year or so is compatible with, at least, my play style. I can't access Tek gear because we can't do bosses. The new creatures all are annoying and broken, there's glitches abound, and if we were to attempt to go on an official there are cheaters galore.\n\nSo with sadness, I cannot recommend this game. It had so much potential, and despite all the new bells and whistles I think the most fun I had with this game was in the first like 3 months it was for sale. When things were simpler, more balanced, and not all about the PvP and $$$.\n\n[Edited for some minor spelling errors...]", "upvoted": false, "time_of_review_unix": 1507507951.0, "minutes_played": 28807, "upvotes_window": 424, "total_window": 748, "percent_window": 0.5668449197860963, "neu_sent": 0.836, "neg_sent": 0.101, "pos_sent": 0.063, "comp_sent": -0.9663, "neu_window": 0.6741108144192249, "neg_window": 0.10014419225634175, "pos_window": 0.22037917222963965, "comp_window": 0.2982424566088121, "percent_window_roc": 0.6347510967003623, "neu_window_roc": 0.8962363106778217, "neg_window_roc": 0.8301783330154492, "pos_window_roc": 0.6737955903821918, "comp_window_roc": 0.6410887030660763, "1day_forecast": 0.00327303565296011, "1day_delta": -0.001490668847191956, "classification": 0.0, "neg_predict": 0.006901931545519847, "pos_predict": 0.040201231228879}, {"time_of_review": "2017-10-10T00:00:54", "review": "Finally tamed my first Gigantosaurus", "upvoted": true, "time_of_review_unix": 1507593654.0, "minutes_played": 12947, "upvotes_window": 435, "total_window": 763, "percent_window": 0.5701179554390564, "neu_sent": 1.0, "neg_sent": 0.0, "pos_sent": 0.0, "comp_sent": 0.0, "neu_window": 0.6721518324607324, "neg_window": 0.10172774869109949, "pos_window": 0.2221753926701572, "comp_window": 0.29745602094240875, "percent_window_roc": 0.6357516828721017, "neu_window_roc": 0.8941759231462023, "neg_window_roc": 0.825028047868362, "pos_window_roc": 0.6727993345402945, "comp_window_roc": 0.6364241756223018, "1day_forecast": 0.011676239811603262, "1day_delta": 0.00327303565296011, "classification": 0.0, "neg_predict": 0.007248428117521602, "pos_predict": 0.045109096529820765}, {"time_of_review": "2017-10-11T00:34:32", "review": "This game is awesome, but there is a lot of negitivity.

You may or may not encounter bugs, and official servers do have their own problems. Overall, my review is an 8 of 10 for Ark despite any issues it may have. It's fun, it's challenging, and it's different. You may only hear about the issues but, in my opinion, the good outweighs the bad. Whether or not the game is worth $60 is up to you. Everyone has a different experience and don't always value games in the same way. Honestly, I'd dare say Ark is better than a lot of AAA titles.\n\nThere is something to be said about the graphics and performance of Ark. I don't know what others are playing on, but my friend has a mid-tier PC. That said, he can run the game on high settings. The point I'm trying to get across is that you should run Ark fine on high if you have a mid-tier PC. Lower mid-tier PCs may struggle a bit on high, but medium should be fine. I honestly don't see how others are having issues unless they're trying to render in 10,000 dinosaurs at once (which isn't a good idea in the first place).\n\nAside from that, it is clear that Ark has beautiful graphics. Small details such as the moon are high resolution rather than just a ball of silver in the sky. My only problem lies with the fog, which looks like someone had a bit too much fun with an airbrush tool. The fog makes vision almost impossible at times and you have another thing coming if you think you can escape it by going underwater. Other than that, Ark is gorgeous.\n\nArk does have it's bugs but I have yet to encounter any that are problematic enough to make me set this to not recommended. There are some that may be a bit frustrating at first but all that I have encountered are bugs that you can reverse. If you have patience, you will be able to enjoy yourself even with these bugs. You just need to take on the mindset of \"things happen.\" Stuck inside your dinosaurs somehow or your dinosaurs are stuck in each other? Wistle them to a new spot. Baby fall through a floor? Pick up the floor (or check the next floor down if you have multiple levels). Dinosaur stuck floating midair on top of another? Punch it. Dinosaur appearing where it isn't (only happens with specific creatures such as Kaprosuchus where putting them in pens may cause them to sink to ground level when they aren't actually that low)? Whistle it to follow and it'll fix itself. Aside from that, there's the issue of ragdoll glitches. Still, this can be fixed by harvesting the body, though sometimes it will go flying away (namely fish; for some reason they have learned to ascend post-death but it's only some of them). It's generally only an issue with smaller creatures, however.\n\nYou will encounter hitbox issues. If you've played the game long enough to know what dinosaurs actually have these issues the most, you will know how to counter it. It isn't hard and only requires a bit of reorganization on your part. Don't want to be smacked off an edge by tails? Put your dinosaurs further away. You know this happens, so move them. Sometimes this issue is actually amusing. Imagine swinging back and forth on the tip of a Diplodocus tail (which is so thin you shouldn't be able to stand on it). It's great.\n\nIf you enjoy a singleplayer sandbox experience, you will absolutely adore this game. It is a lot of fun and, with mods and maps, it is endless fun. Don't like player made mods but want to mess with rates? You can. Ark is completely modifiable even in singleplayer. Just make sure you know what the values do (some aren't self-explanatory if you don't know much on the game) or you may have quite an interesting experience to say the least.\n\nI, personally, do not usually play official servers. With that in mind, I can't say much aside from what I have heard of them. You can find good PvP servers, though they are few and far between. Most have alpha tribes that more or less run the server and, honestly, I'm not a big fan of occasional server wipes unless it is really needed. For those servers it is quite possible it is needed but, as I run my own server, I am aware that there are servers that can run much more smoothly for longer periods of time without being wiped at all. In any case, that much is up to you. A lot of people enjoy the official PvE servers, so I think that says enough about those. Other than that, I've heard that official servers are very laggy. Personally, I have played on only three and do agree that has been a trend among them even with a low population. It's very frustrating, honestly.\n\nOverall, I recommend playing on unofficial servers. There are some that run vanilla settings, though some are a bit modified. They range from different levels of modification as well, so you can have something completely broken in the name of fun or something entirely balanced. These are your best bet if you want fully moderated and balanced PvP. Most of these little server communities are also very relaxed and fun. I've seen a lot of really awesome people come and go on servers like these. If you really like interaction, these are the way to go.

My boyfriend who also shelled out another $60 so he can play it with me has an Alienware and it still glitches!! WE have TRIED to play this game and can barely get it to run without some troubles or another. WASTE of money!!!!! Only bought it cause my sis said I might like it (she has PS4, so she isn't having any issues). Don't get unless you figure out if you want it within 2hours of playtime and within 2 weeks of purchase. Took me 6+hours to download BTW!

The first is the clear lack of effort put into the gameplay and the game world. Yes, this game has tons of creatures in it, but that doesn`t mean anything when the AI for all of them is so extreamly basic that it completely ruins the gameplay. If an animal is aggresive, it will just attack everything in sight, no matter what it is, untill something kills it. This is made worse given the fact that animals are covering every inch of the island. That means that you can`t explore or get resources without imediatly running into something that will rip your face off. That woulf be fine and even fun IF there were gameplay mechanics that allowed the player to avoid that. But there isn`t. For example, maybe you try to tame some giant herbivore so that predators will leave you alone while you ride it, because that makes sense. However, it doesn`t matter if you are ridding something the size of a mountain that`s covered in spikes, sweets acid, and breaths fire, any and all agressive animals will still attack you.

Also, it was already rife with graphics bugs, and the SE added more. The SteamOS player will spend a good portion of his/her \"play\" time compensating for graphics bugs.\n\nThe devs seem very keen to add content, which would be great if it didn't make the game less playable. IMO, they need to put the brakes on providing content, fix whatever has caused the game to take such a massive performance hit (post-SE), then ensure their future content updates don't ruin the game again.\n\nFix the game and I'll update my review.\n\nEdit Jan 15 2017 - I've upgraded my video card to a 6G GTX1060 and am regularly seeing 40fps at 1080p.

Early game I was into a tough fight with a level 2 raptor, only to then be suddenly one-shotted from behind by a level 33 raptor. Some feature to allow certain level groups only in certain areas would be much appreciated.

It's a frustrating, but enjoyable survival game for both single player and multiplayer gamers, though, it's disappointing that the developers seem to be focusing moreso on content than optimization. \nThis game is extremely difficult to run on the lowest of settings. If you have the minimum requirements listed here on steam, you will NOT be able to play it without your computer either overheating within half an hour, or it being so laggy that its basically unplayable. (I have a Nvidia GTX 960, minimum is the GTX 670. My card isn't way better, but it's past the minimum so you'd assume the game'd run smooth but yeah lmao all it does is make my computer a new heater for the cold months.)\n\nBesides graphical strain, the gameplay is nice. The taming and building systems are complicated, but easy to get used to (mind you there are no in-game tutorials) and the variety of tameable creatures compensates for the lack of weapon variety. \nBosses are too overpowered, crafting engrams are extremely linear so you have to learn everything or learn nothing, early-game pits you against enemies much stronger than you, and late game gives you not much to do except defeat the bosses and I guess tame every single dinosaur in the game. \nLuckily, there are now customizeable world settings that can amp up things such as taming speed (It can take up to 3+ hours to tame 1 mid-game dinosaur), breeding speed (some dinos take actual days, and I mean real 24 hour days to regen. This doesn't seem so bad until you realize that your Therizinosaurus takes 11 days and you're on single player), and an assortment of things that take way too long. Even for a multiplayer-based game, some of the difficulty spikes and wait times are insane.\n\nEither way, ARK: Survival Evolved is a decent game if you have a good setup with a GTX 1080 and like 1 terabyte of ram. Also the community has some pretty great mods that helped me get over 200 hours in lmao.

Then add some mods from the workshop to create a more unique experience and your good to go, you can enjoy the game with no interference from others.\n\n2) Mods - The mod community is amazing in this game. With a wide range of choice that can simply add some different building materials, to mods that overhaul the entire game there is something for everyone. It adds endless replayability... \n\n3) The gameplay - The game is very fun and relaxing to play, whether you be on your own or on a server with others, and is very easy to sink many hours into. Building is enjoyable, especially with mods. Taming is fun and can be incredibly heart pounding in certain situations, as well as satisfying. Exploring is a great time kill and allows you to take in the scenery.\n\n4) The graphics - The game is absolutely beautful to look at, if you have the hardware to push the higher settings. You will find yourself sometimes just admiring the scenery.\n\n5) Un-official servers - While you should take caution on picking a player hosted server, they are still far better than officials. Most have higher rates for less grindy gameplay and offer mods. Admins also watch over the server, which can either be good or bad. The only thing to keep in mind is that these servers can go down at any time, and maybe never come back. Keep that in mind before choosing. \n\n6) Self-hosting - If you don't like what current servers offer, setup your own! Offer it out for anyone to join, or stick a password on it and play with your friends.\n\nNow...\nWhat 'ARK Survival Evolved' does wrong:\n\n1) Official servers - These are a complete free-for-all. With absolutely zero rules in place it's a lawless land where anarchy reigns. From servers that are just pillared, so you can't build anywhere, to servers that are ruled like an iron fist by established tribes, it's not a fun experience. This is not helped by the slow rates on official servers. Everything that takes forever to do, can be destroyed in seconds. Stay away from these! You will thank me later.\n\n2) Bugs, glitches and cheaters - Self explanatory this one. Bugs still exist in the game, some that go back months or years. Glitches can break the game completely, allowing players under the map in some cases. And cheaters are.... just that, sad excuse for human beings. Every game has cheaters and this game is no exception.\n\n3) Support - While im sure Wildcard do take in player feedback and suggestions, it just does not feel like it. They are not the worst company in terms of keeping their playerbase in the know, in fact I would say they are one of the best, but when it comes to answering tickets for help from players, help is non-existant.\n\nThat's just a quick overview. I would recommend this game to those who like to play alone, or with friends. Enjoy a grind. Are a fan of the open world sandbox style gameplay. And like dinosaurs, I mean they are the highlight after all! ;)", "upvoted": true, "time_of_review_unix": 1519086081.0, "minutes_played": 77134, "upvotes_window": 472, "total_window": 760, "percent_window": 0.6210526315789474, "neu_sent": 0.802, "neg_sent": 0.054, "pos_sent": 0.144, "comp_sent": 0.9924, "neu_window": 0.6784848883048618, "neg_window": 0.09716294349540075, "pos_window": 0.22041787122207615, "comp_window": 0.28655689881734564, "percent_window_roc": 0.7163506664163695, "neu_window_roc": 0.8925018866688943, "neg_window_roc": 0.7947015205556598, "pos_window_roc": 0.7000135090326305, "comp_window_roc": 0.6389330751319824, "1day_forecast": -0.007904717546077578, "1day_delta": 0.0008868857225937665, "classification": 0.0, "neg_predict": 0.025072431795510133, "pos_predict": 0.023654281456012317}, {"time_of_review": "2018-02-21T00:00:15", "review": "best game ever made wildcard please soon give xbox mods\n", "upvoted": true, "time_of_review_unix": 1519171215.0, "minutes_played": 23838, "upvotes_window": 485, "total_window": 791, "percent_window": 0.6131479140328698, "neu_sent": 0.552, "neg_sent": 0.0, "pos_sent": 0.448, "comp_sent": 0.7579, "neu_window": 0.6803648989898989, "neg_window": 0.0990568181818182, "pos_window": 0.21679419191919194, "comp_window": 0.2926829545454546, "percent_window_roc": 0.7128427128427128, "neu_window_roc": 0.894202077818109, "neg_window_roc": 0.7958603896103896, "pos_window_roc": 0.6922810661128418, "comp_window_roc": 0.6292087542087541, "1day_forecast": 0.011421546357486045, "1day_delta": -0.007904717546077578, "classification": 0.0, "neg_predict": 0.020616420639571822, "pos_predict": 0.01750225006947415}, {"time_of_review": "2018-02-22T00:17:05", "review": "I am so frustrated, I play on a pc and every time I try to enter back to my pve I don't have any of my progress and I only have my engrams so I have to start all over again", "upvoted": true, "time_of_review_unix": 1519258625.0, "minutes_played": 1407, "upvotes_window": 544, "total_window": 871, "percent_window": 0.6245694603903559, "neu_sent": 0.772, "neg_sent": 0.092, "pos_sent": 0.136, "comp_sent": 0.1987, "neu_window": 0.6805022935779804, "neg_window": 0.09769495412844038, "pos_window": 0.21836697247706433, "comp_window": 0.28962694954128443, "percent_window_roc": 0.710353866317169, "neu_window_roc": 0.8953478444085172, "neg_window_roc": 0.8107593381389252, "pos_window_roc": 0.6895024150447283, "comp_window_roc": 0.6200708192499597, "1day_forecast": 0.004061245003834979, "1day_delta": 0.011421546357486045, "classification": 0.0, "neg_predict": 0.012582823074090754, "pos_predict": 0.02622666068762373}, {"time_of_review": "2018-02-23T00:22:36", "review": "Do not buy this game until/if they decide to fix the performance issues.\n\n1070ti + i7 @ 4.2ghz = 40-55fps on medium settings 1080p.

It will eat hours of your life almost as fast as the dinosaurs you are riding eat little dinos. Building, Crafting, and Taming are a huge part of this game which all require farming and prep work. Do not get this game if you are not ready to play at least 10 hrs weekly, whereas many will find themselves putting in that many a day sometimes. I like the challenge of a solo survival, but their are plenty of tribes comprised of groups. I do work with other tribes through Alliances sometimes as there are a few things that are difficult to complete alone and why play online if you never interact with others.

The potential is there for this game to be even more stunning than it already is. It has a pretty active modding community that adds all kinds of cool ideas to the game, not even counting custom maps. You can start it up and after the 5 minute load time you'll suddenly have lost 7 hours of your day. It's gorgeous, it's different, it's completely addicting.

More creatures, better AI, better look, better handling - and even with some bugs and glitches it works really nicely and is an awesome timesink for those who want a multiplayer/coop survival experience. \nAnd here comes the but, and it's a big BUT, indeed:\n\n1. ARK Survival evolved comes with free official multiplayer servers - usually for up to 70 people. But the servers actually can not handle half of the max population without lag spikes from here to Mars. With the mediocre shardware server structure a ARK game can quickly become an issue - because it feels like you are playing with an ancient 56k modem.\nEven with a pretty modern PC and a extremly fast internet there are losts of issues causing lag - so there are quite a few construction sites in this game, that need to be fixed. Sadly, although this game is looking quite nice, those problems make the game experience quite gruffy!\n\n2. Since Scorched Earth is online, people are transporting items and/or creatures from one game mode to another. That quickly evolved to a overly large problem, because big tribes and grievers are using this to their advantage, occupying one or several servers, killing off new gamers, destroying others structures and generally harassing people. \nThe possibility of traveling between servers and bringing over ressources and OP creatures killed a lot of the unique envirioment qualities the maps had - and enabled grieving even more.\n\n3. Which leads to another problem: the developer \"Studio Wildcard\" is in general looking after the servers - like server structure - but there are no admins (available). People can do whatever they feel like, which gives grievers and big tribes easy access to rule their server - or even plural -servers. There are a few servers, where a few people are in control of the maps, with walls, spring guns and tamed agressiv dino armies on each spawn point, walled off and spring gunned ressource plots and so called \"task forces\" on wyverns killing each new player they can get.\nThere are even \"events\" by some big tribes, where they do head hunts in groups up to 20 people - camping spawn positions, killing people and using pvp equipment like shakles and cages, so people can't play later on on those servers.\n\nAll in all - the game itself is really awesome - but I STRONGLY recommand, that you set up your own private(!) server, if you want to play with others, or you play solo on your own comp.\nThe way Studio Wildcard's policy is set up for public servers and the community on those is FUBAR at the moment, so there is almost no way, one can play this game alone or with friends on public servers atm.\nAround 28 Euros are way too much for getting constantly griefed + harassed by other players and not supported by the game developer AND the constant problems causing lag spikes.\n\nUnless the policy turns around, or you have access to a private server,\nI CANNOT RECOMMEND this game to new gamers AT ALL!\n\nUNLESS you play solo or have your own dedicated server - then it's actually quite fun.", "upvoted": false, "time_of_review_unix": 1521504624.0, "minutes_played": 34577, "upvotes_window": 330, "total_window": 550, "percent_window": 0.6, "neu_sent": 0.721, "neg_sent": 0.155, "pos_sent": 0.123, "comp_sent": -0.9844, "neu_window": 0.6777259528130671, "neg_window": 0.09792377495462794, "pos_window": 0.21707259528130668, "comp_window": 0.2842938294010887, "percent_window_roc": 0.6616541353383459, "neu_window_roc": 0.8975656825476563, "neg_window_roc": 0.8038631060409644, "pos_window_roc": 0.661499058635955, "comp_window_roc": 0.567548635654472, "1day_forecast": 0.003669724770642202, "1day_delta": 0.005923344947735165, "classification": 0.0, "neg_predict": 0.00754148993680149, "pos_predict": 0.06294008434935756}, {"time_of_review": "2018-03-21T00:51:26", "review": "In my opinion, Ark has the potential to be a great game, but, unfortunately, it is developed by people who have no idea what they are doing, and are just trying to make as much money off of the game as possible, they released paid DLC while the game was still full of bugs, and continue to add new features and DLC while the game is still buggy, it is now in full release and the game is still not very good. but I like the style, I wish they would sell the rights to another game developement company so they can make it better.", "upvoted": false, "time_of_review_unix": 1521593486.0, "minutes_played": 27235, "upvotes_window": 328, "total_window": 545, "percent_window": 0.6018348623853211, "neu_sent": 0.806, "neg_sent": 0.079, "pos_sent": 0.115, "comp_sent": 0.6441, "neu_window": 0.6772673992673991, "neg_window": 0.09746520146520148, "pos_window": 0.21975274725274732, "comp_window": 0.2817424908424907, "percent_window_roc": 0.663526949241235, "neu_window_roc": 0.898538867317012, "neg_window_roc": 0.8112244897959183, "pos_window_roc": 0.6618511291408488, "comp_window_roc": 0.5653556969346443, "1day_forecast": 0.010596581855995102, "1day_delta": 0.0029237916049218438, "classification": 0.0, "neg_predict": 0.007229345558569278, "pos_predict": 0.07267550856427353}, {"time_of_review": "2018-03-22T00:07:55", "review": "The biggest drawback is that the \"60GB hard drive space available\" is a little off.

You're not into these kinds of games? I recommend it. Your grandmother doesn't even know how to work her nokia? Recommend Ark. Whatever, I love this game, it's great.\n\nWhy I love Ark.\n\nSo starting off the game in early access day one, of course it had it's issues. My friend and I rushed to download it, we had been waiting for months. We got on found a server, jumped in and woke up on the beach. Realizing we were only getting 15 frames on medium settings, rip frames.\nPlayed for a bit, built a little hatch 2x2, got killed by raptors.\nWalked by a small little lake, looked in saw 999999x megalodons. Dope.\nGot to our house, heard people in the distance, ran to say hello.\nGot dark, saw torch in the distant shrubbery.\nI made a spear trying to figure out how to use, I launched it into friends heel, he took no dmg. Dope.\nLost frames, ran into water on accident, 999999x ate my face. Dope.\nALSO we sat around taming a level 24 T-rex for 5 hours. 3 of us, took turns running out to kill Stegos to get prime, run back and put it in its belly before the meat spoiled. While the others sat around defending the knocked out Rex. The memories. My butt still hurts from sitting down for that long worrying about the Rex.\n  After Optimization\nNo more 99999x megas, and no more huge scary frame drops.\nMany more dinos, bigger dinos, scary dinos, little dinos, cute dinos.\nMuch more contect, more maps, more buildings, just so much stuff to do and dope freaking dinosaurs to tame.\nSimply put, this game is amazing. The gameplay is great, the mechanics are amazing. Graphics are top notch now too.\nThe vanilla servers can feel like a grind, but there's non-official servers with some amazing mods which can give you the chance to jump in tame all dinos build amazing bases and still have stuff to do for hours just to see all the game has to offer. This game doesn't run out of content unless you play 9999x gather/tame, even then it's so much fun for days on end. Also good for those who don't have all the time in the world to sit around for hours taming a t-rex. :P  It has so much to offer. The dinosaurs and creatures can help you farm and gather materials too so you're not completely on your own.\nThis game is 100% worth it.\nThis was my first ever review of a game, sorry it's all over the place.

Aside from alpha tribes ruleing the official servers and gimping anyone elses playability (walls around start zones, giant armed bases a few steps from the start area)  the main servers are so laggy people cant even play on them they must go to third party hosted servers because of the amount of things that are built.  the tutorial for the game is non exisitant you start naked with nothing in the middle of nowhere.  i spent my first few lives punching a bird thing on the shore and as i punched it it slid across the ground (beautifully i might add) and when i killed it i got a feather.....who do i do with this.... oh right no tutorial i guess ill eat the birds shit it made as i was punching it.  and that kills me ok i will have to note that down someplace.  so 45 minutes after a \"friend\" of mine finnaly finds me on this giant flying dinosaur he shows up and kills me after saying \"omg there is a guy on the beach\"  and as i say yes thats me he kills me since there are no nametags i spawn randomly and after another 20 minutes get picked up on a one man rideable flying dino that we bug out with me laying on top of it not actually riding it and i get taken to this base of his tribes way way up in the mountains where theres snow and its cold.....i dont even know how to make a um anything and now im in the arctic top of the mountains so as i die over and over now that im bound up here hes telling me all about how good the game is.  i say soo ive died 4 times and have no idea how to survive here but these 2 giant brontasaurus have shit right next to each other so i devower their shit in one bite each and it kills me in record time i log out say ok man im done with this the game looks terrible it looks like turok from nintendo 64 the movement is glitchy the server lags like crazy ive died 11 times i have no idea how to survive and i used to like dinosaurs when i was 7 but now they are stupid and there is a reason they are all extinct because nobody cared.  so i returned the game for a refund and with my refund i bought supply and pet crates for fallout shelter.  now with that being said i have long since deleted the vault i purchased the crates for and i would be willing to bet that i never even got more then 50 people in the vault but the amount of joy i got from those crates was way way way more then i would have ever got if i kept ark.  (and i payed for it when it was half off)  all in all if they take out the dinosaurs take out the building aspect switch the game engine and not make the people look like cavemen it would be a good

The PvP system is horrible. Higher level players will just pick you up with their bird and drop you to your death, or shoot you with a rifle to get a faster death(if you're lucky). The PvE system is a whole lot worse than the PvP system. You get random alphas (dinos that are 20x stronger and faster  than the regular dinos) spawning in the STARTING ZONES (why df would developers implement that, I cannot understand; extremely unfriendly to new players and DOESN'T add to the difficulty of the game; difficulty should involve skill, being spawned next to a dino you can not fight or run from is not based on skill, it's just stupid slaughter over slaughter over slaughter again and again; unless you're a masochist you won't enjoy this game). Also loged into the game a few times discovering I have a disease from who knows what, even though I've been in my house the whole time. Incredibly hard to get rid of diseases and it's impossible to play with them (you get only 25% resources and impact on life and damage). You cannot get rid of it by dying; getting an antidote will cost you at least 2-3 hours. TAMING DINOS: decent in concept, horrible execution. The taming process isn't a very far stretch, it's moderately difficult, the problem comes when a lvl 100+ Rex spawns right near your base and kills all the dinos you've spent 5+ hours to tame, and all that happens while you are offline. HOW DOES THAT IMPROVE THE GAMEPLAY? I don't understand these developers.\nAfter about 100 hours of playing this(not on this accout) I consider this game to be trash.

Well a lot changed in time. They fixed a lot of bugs, added a lot more content. Sadly, not enough for the price anymore. I have been getting the same bugs for last 2-3 years and even though they fixed a lot, there is still a ton of game breaking bugs. Shows you how shit the game was when I first bought it. Though it was early access at that time so I was hoping they would be fixed in time. NOPE. Wildcard just loves to rush unfinished content and even that they always have delays.\n\nDon't get me wrong ark is a fun game with friends in the right server but that's hard to find nowadays. Most people are getting bored of it and only coming back when there is a content update. Which is the reason wildcard adds more content then bug fixes. And bugs cause people to get annoyed and leave... so a endless cycle there.\n\nAlso there is a huge problem in the endgame which causes people to leave. It is useless and boring in any Pve server! Just breeding one type of dino couple dozen times and going into the bosses just to leave afk for 10 mins and do this over and over again to farm element is not fun Wildcard. Simple as that. Some people might argue that's the grind. Well for what ? A tek feeding through that you needed while breeding all those rexes for bosses ? A tek trinsmitter that would save you from walking your rexes to the closest obelisk for boss fights or help you quickly change between maps so you can get the resources you need ? Could continue this for every single tek thing but no reason. Tek is useless in Pve. By the time you get them, you don't need them anymore. The only point they are really usefull is while getting ready for boss fights or mass raising babies.... Well that's all done by the point you get to Tek tier. \nI don't play pvp, well not since SE release but I'm guessing it's useless there as well. Armors are too costly to lose in any raid and I tried the weapons.... no dmg compared to the blueprints you can get for normal sutff.\n\nSo if you never played this game and wanan try, hopefully you got a community set up already or you won't be having much fun after a point. Exploring new games is always fun, it is true in ark as well. But that's it if you are alone.\n\nIf you are coming back from a break, well don't.

The more I played it the more I realized the only reason it was fun was because I had literally nothing better to do. I had recently fractured my C7 Vertebrae in my neck and this happened to be what I played during a good chunk of my recovery. The game is entirely built around the idea that you have a \"tribe\" of people to play with, that you meet in the game, or friends. Everything in the game is so hard to obtain that without teammates it is really a futile effort. Playing singleplayer with the rates turned up just leaves you with an empty feeling inside.\n\nIt takes HOURS to tame dinosaurs, where you quite literally sit around and make sure it doesn't get killed by incessantly stubborn and hungry predators that will kill you and take all your loot, kill the dino you flew across the map to get the the Argentavis that is 90% tamed, and then kill that too.  This idle grinding mechanic makes it easy to watch netflix while you play but makes it real shitty when some dude with no life that spends 14 hours a day on the server decides to run around and kill all the other players for not giving him what he wanted.\n\nTL;DR\nI feel like people should be paying me to play this game, because it feels like straight up work.\nThat and unless you're a politician you are likely going to have all your progress griefed by other players.\nstill fun till you realize how much time you waste", "upvoted": false, "time_of_review_unix": 1528330474.0, "minutes_played": 13977, "upvotes_window": 298, "total_window": 439, "percent_window": 0.6788154897494305, "neu_sent": 0.735, "neg_sent": 0.119, "pos_sent": 0.145, "comp_sent": 0.2881, "neu_window": 0.6570340909090907, "neg_window": 0.08304772727272725, "pos_window": 0.2553545454545455, "comp_window": 0.37102840909090923, "percent_window_roc": 0.7610389610389611, "neu_window_roc": 0.8602323899456893, "neg_window_roc": 0.6775568181818181, "pos_window_roc": 0.7929764939110733, "comp_window_roc": 0.710725677830941, "1day_forecast": 0.022360980838804778, "1day_delta": -0.004111339518862223, "classification": 0.0, "neg_predict": 0.12694910542910826, "pos_predict": 0.05014807085636704}, {"time_of_review": "2018-06-08T00:19:20", "review": "10/10\nBest game purchase Ive done", "upvoted": true, "time_of_review_unix": 1528417160.0, "minutes_played": 39012, "upvotes_window": 298, "total_window": 425, "percent_window": 0.7011764705882353, "neu_sent": 0.543, "neg_sent": 0.0, "pos_sent": 0.457, "comp_sent": 0.6369, "neu_window": 0.6544765258215963, "neg_window": 0.08305399061032864, "pos_window": 0.2553967136150235, "comp_window": 0.38235751173708954, "percent_window_roc": 0.7645875251509054, "neu_window_roc": 0.8606404765025659, "neg_window_roc": 0.6798289738430583, "pos_window_roc": 0.7970982697848565, "comp_window_roc": 0.715138785931966, "1day_forecast": -0.01442948263642807, "1day_delta": 0.021631016042780726, "classification": 0.0, "neg_predict": 0.07750756682344365, "pos_predict": 0.06204453034507281}, {"time_of_review": "2018-06-09T00:03:01", "review": "shity and boring", "upvoted": false, "time_of_review_unix": 1528502581.0, "minutes_played": 13577, "upvotes_window": 285, "total_window": 415, "percent_window": 0.6867469879518072, "neu_sent": 0.465, "neg_sent": 0.535, "pos_sent": 0.0, "comp_sent": -0.3182, "neu_window": 0.6476730769230765, "neg_window": 0.0875456730769231, "pos_window": 0.2575288461538461, "comp_window": 0.3627805288461541, "percent_window_roc": 0.7692307692307693, "neu_window_roc": 0.8591372133570423, "neg_window_roc": 0.6756953983516483, "pos_window_roc": 0.8012820512820512, "comp_window_roc": 0.7226298920377867, "1day_forecast": -0.00850624721106652, "1day_delta": -0.01442948263642807, "classification": 0.0, "neg_predict": 0.16817833939383686, "pos_predict": 0.05691286207894005}, {"time_of_review": "2018-06-10T00:24:12", "review": "This game is HORRIBLE I can't even run the game on the lowest graphics keep playing Minecraft kid's nothing to see here.

It is great to play with your friends and have fun just taming dinos, building a base, RPing with the server (My favorite part) and raiding a base or two. This is a game where you can easily get sucked into for hours. Now alot of people complain about optimization where it is lacking in. You should be fine if you dont use your Windows XP computer to run the game but a average computer should be fine if you are willing to drop a few graphic levels from max. Another complaint about ark is the trolling and greifing in the servers. This sometimes happens but usally most servers have rules against it. Some may be worried about price and i say that I wouldn't pay $60 for it I would wait for a sale, I bought the game when it was early access before most of the dinos that are in the game now where even in for $20 which I thought was a good deal.

To recoup funds they are double dipping on fan base.\n     - Not well balanced. Game is very top heavy and favors the 1%. Once you reach alpha trib status its nigh impossible to get knocked off.\n\nOther thoughts... I usually won't list optimization and bugs as cons for an Alpha game because that is expected. But when you need to buy a dlc to play a better performance version of the game then it's pretty safe to say those issues are here to stay.

For those who enjoy grinding such as myself find this game very addictive and enjoyable. The grinding consist of waiting up to 8hrs or more to tame a single animal which is more than likely to be killed within the next day. Allowing tribes from other servers to transfer animals and tools has been a great way in keeping down new players and small tribes. Example being as my friends and I over the course of four day tamed a decent amount of animals and gained small amounts of resources. An alpha tribe (Biggest tribe) from another server decided it would be fun to hit us. As the tribe wanted nothing from us they burned and killed every animal taking nothing. As the pvp is AMAZING in this game I find many things are unbalanced. Meshing is a HUGE problem, its a shame that a single man can mesh through something as the abberation surface cave passing hundreds of turrets and blowing everything behind them. The single auto turrets compare nothing to those of the heavy turrets. Those who arent a hundred cannot build these and arent able to seriously defend there base. The DLC is also a given advantage with those who purchase extra maps recieve those of flame throwers and glider suits. The game is highly addictive but definitily needs to be worked on. Its very stressful when hours of work go to waist.

Best of all, there are Dinos and you can Tame them. (The hair even grows in time bonus)\n\nNegative : Only 2 models, 1 male 1 feale. Only thing you can change are some proportions changes and is often use for charicatures wich can break any immersion. The movements are stiff and the game is punishing if you play alone. There are no tutorials and even when you tame dinos, its not like they have quirks. Just feed em and use em. Its also a game designed for multiplayer only. You can play solo but good luck unless you change the stats to give you an immense advantage.\n\nI recommend the game for players who seek to chill out, do adjust day and night cycle as night time makes it imposible to see and very dangerous. If the designers of this game would ever look at reviews and find this, here's a tip. Get character models like Conana exiles, keep the rest, do think of a single player friendly option, give more customisation options and please, do consider the posibilities of making it open to import alien and fantaasy species into the game. That would make the game so goddamn great. Aliens over there, orcs and elfs over here... theres a dwarf not to step on and OH, make some humanoid NPC that do more then just stand around? Conan is another game of the genre thats fun but aside from Models and animations, Ark beat it on everything else. If we could get settlers as an option to give jobs to, that could make the world seem with infinit possibilities... specialy with custum races imported settlers..", "upvoted": true, "time_of_review_unix": 1532652020.0, "minutes_played": 26235, "upvotes_window": 331, "total_window": 495, "percent_window": 0.6686868686868687, "neu_sent": 0.806, "neg_sent": 0.053, "pos_sent": 0.141, "comp_sent": 0.9832, "neu_window": 0.6832903225806447, "neg_window": 0.08801008064516126, "pos_window": 0.22467137096774195, "comp_window": 0.3448076612903227, "percent_window_roc": 0.7211981566820277, "neu_window_roc": 0.8987141805715614, "neg_window_roc": 0.8071356566820276, "pos_window_roc": 0.6657622349512612, "comp_window_roc": 0.5979414261460102, "1day_forecast": -0.007332287013561922, "1day_delta": 0.0147633274393838, "classification": 0.0, "neg_predict": 0.0026236065988005353, "pos_predict": 0.022203474196760713}, {"time_of_review": "2018-07-28T00:33:48", "review": "I ate my own sh!t and died.", "upvoted": false, "time_of_review_unix": 1532738028.0, "minutes_played": 520, "upvotes_window": 332, "total_window": 502, "percent_window": 0.6613545816733067, "neu_sent": 0.562, "neg_sent": 0.438, "pos_sent": 0.0, "comp_sent": -0.5983, "neu_window": 0.6774413518886679, "neg_window": 0.08793041749502978, "pos_window": 0.23065805168986084, "comp_window": 0.34912405566600385, "percent_window_roc": 0.7247940925873332, "neu_window_roc": 0.8993167981006188, "neg_window_roc": 0.7959031525134904, "pos_window_roc": 0.6688838929042566, "comp_window_roc": 0.6056642600537128, "1day_forecast": 0.001196858655911348, "1day_delta": -0.007332287013561922, "classification": 0.0, "neg_predict": 0.00465064478345331, "pos_predict": 0.021801057651148686}, {"time_of_review": "2018-07-29T00:15:23", "review": "Its a great game.", "upvoted": true, "time_of_review_unix": 1532823323.0, "minutes_played": 47753, "upvotes_window": 322, "total_window": 485, "percent_window": 0.6639175257731958, "neu_sent": 0.328, "neg_sent": 0.0, "pos_sent": 0.672, "comp_sent": 0.6249, "neu_window": 0.6717777777777779, "neg_window": 0.09075925925925925, "pos_window": 0.23336008230452676, "comp_window": 0.3464438271604937, "percent_window_roc": 0.72663139329806, "neu_window_roc": 0.8982108463578826, "neg_window_roc": 0.788690476190476, "pos_window_roc": 0.6730510364985961, "comp_window_roc": 0.6185473972998339, "1day_forecast": 0.01724189451665925, "1day_delta": 0.0025629440998891084, "classification": 0.0, "neg_predict": 0.006400121098392125, "pos_predict": 0.02368048482355945}, {"time_of_review": "2018-07-30T00:26:14", "review": "As of this moment I have played 761 hours of ARK: Survival Evolved.

Most of the mods for it are what make it fun, and if you can't manage to get a friend to run a save or buy a dedicated server for you and your buddies, it's not worth it. The official servers are almost impossible for a new player to get going in, one of the biggest issues being not only the fact that as soon as you spawn you can look out into the world and just see a shit ton of ugly as hell player bases full of tame dinos, but that seeing those bases makes your game want to shit itself no matter what settings you have it on or what computer you have.\n\nI wasn't joking about the bugs either. The game controls like shit and you'd be surprised how many times I've fallen through floors, glitched into walls and gotten stuck, ended up glitching rockdrakes into walls and killing them because of whatever reason, suddenly falling off of griffons and pterodactyls when three stories above the ground, and other stupid shit.\n\nFor $60 you can buy two copies of The Phantom Pain when it's not on sale, four copies of CS:GO, six copies of Rocket League I think, and a lot of other, better games.

It simply requires too much dedication to enjoy to it's fullest potential. Changed my review to unrecommended. Work hard so you can have fun later makes sense in theory; but the hamster wheel never stops spinning here. Save your time and dignity.\n\nEDIT 2 One-Year-Later:\nPopped onto my friend's server to mess around with his maxed-out dinos and gears. What the developer has done with most of this time is focus on adding new content to the game. I loved all of the dino and equipment additions (and if I understand correctly, a new tech tree is on the way) However, many of my oringal problems with the game remain, namely the bugs and server lag. I was disappointed to see that you could still clip dinosaurs through your opponents base walls and kill them while they are \"poking through\" solid material. The rubberbanding is ever-present and really is quite capable of disrupting the play flow. I'll be visiting ARK again when it releases to see if it's something really worth digging into.\n\nEDIT: I quit playing this game about two months after buying it. It could be fun in small bursts if you get to play with multiple friends. But to really get the most out of the game you have to commit hours to it a day even to just maintain what you have. Fun game but will ultimately become a chore. Dino taming MMO was still a great idea though. (Really wish the animations were better though)\n\nInterestingly, as many have mentioned before me, this game brings me back to my early World of Warcraft days. A persistant online world full of people and adventure waiting to be explored. It reminds me of my initial excitement of discovering Azeroth for the first time. (I hate WoW now ofc)\n\nReasons to Buy:\n+Leveling System (persists through death)\n+Pokemon-esque dinosaur taming, riding, and leveling sytem where you choose their stats\n+Deep base building mechanics\n+Interact with players on your own terms, there is no scripted or uncontrollable interactions between players, you can choose to be diplomatic, KOS (kill on sight), ally, or knock someone out with tranq arrows and drag their unconsious body into a metal prison cell with a tiny open window for you to periodically fire a new tranq arrow into, rendering their character unplayable while you use their body to draw blood for \"medpacks\" and collect their poop for fertilizer. (Or feed them their own poop) :D\n\nReasons to Wait:\n+Overall Game Balance (PvP interactions need work)\n+Server Lag, periodically your character and dinos will \"rubberband (bounce back and forth)\n\nReasons to Not Buy:\n+You dont have at least a few hours every couple days to maintain your base/dinos.\n+Can't stand losing everything in an instant", "upvoted": false, "time_of_review_unix": 1535761878.0, "minutes_played": 14376, "upvotes_window": 218, "total_window": 322, "percent_window": 0.6770186335403726, "neu_sent": 0.756, "neg_sent": 0.082, "pos_sent": 0.161, "comp_sent": 0.9926, "neu_window": 0.684498452012384, "neg_window": 0.0811176470588235, "pos_window": 0.22509907120743028, "comp_window": 0.3194095975232199, "percent_window_roc": 0.7748783724015922, "neu_window_roc": 0.8901035678535347, "neg_window_roc": 0.6856479433878814, "pos_window_roc": 0.7233586991117155, "comp_window_roc": 0.7120743034055728, "1day_forecast": -0.0018593978715828463, "1day_delta": -0.004938553003969837, "classification": 0.0, "neg_predict": 0.1723904417195168, "pos_predict": 0.006714474505037278}, {"time_of_review": "2018-09-02T01:53:27", "review": "I just bought ARK.

"review": "I would not recommend this game souly out of disrespect toward the Dev team, because I feel disrespected by them for not listening to a single word the community has said for the 1000+ hours ive played. Don't get me wrong, the games visuals are 10/10 if your computer is beafy enough to even run the game at that high of a level of detail. The dinosaurs are also interesting and really cool looking, some with really nice abilities and some with really broken ones. On single player the problems are the most hidden, so i can see how someone could give this a 10/10 for singleplayer. In this review im going to be talking about ARK's multiplayer, so if you only play single player you don't have to read the rest of this unless you plan on going official.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n\nStill looking for why the devs are to blame? first lets take a look at their server purchasing website:\nhttps://server.nitrado.net/usa/offers/ark-survival-evolved?pk_campaign=INT_ARK  (link incase you want to see yourself)\n\n\"Use skill and cunning to kill ARK dinosaurs and primeval creatures, break out and ride, and unite with other players!\"\nthe only skill you need to combat the brain dead AI is finding a rock tall enough to shoot from, as they aren't smart enough to go around a rock or follow you through a certain area without getting stuck on something. This goes for tamed dinosaurs too.\n\n\"Studio Wildcard has created a huge world with ARK: Survival Evolved, in which the only rule will be \"eat or be eaten\".\"\nThe real rule is find a tribe or on average you never make it passed lvl 50, and more than half of the huge worlds are behind 20$ pay barriers.\n\nThere are several other problems involving balance on PVP. The DLC's contain powerful dinosaurs that normal players don't have access to, creating a pay to win factor for those who bought the expansions. Other mechanics also create problems for new players, such as boat sweeping (running your boat into a beach to trap a newbie and his dinos inside for you to kill) which creates a really hostile environment for people just starting on PVP.\n\nPVE is probably the most broken section of ark. If you didn't know by now, servers actually have taming caps, so an entire server of 70 people can't go over a 4000 tame limit, which if you did the math is completely broken. on average you wil see maybe 15 people on a server. Theres a 400 tame cap within a tribe. With that logic the server has room for 10 people to tame their cap of creatures. and a server player cap as I said is normaly 70-100. Looking at servers today you wil find that almost every single one is capped or near capping, unless you are on the expansion maps, which are slightly less croweded.\n\nOn Aberration the glitches are still unfixed from day one of it's release. People on the servers are more scared of falling through the map with their dinos then they are of a server cap. Customer services are almost always backed up for these reasons, the dev team simply never optomized their game. They instead created more and more content without optomization which lead to even more bugs and broken gameplay.\n\nThere are other cases that show the devs completely ignoring its players, they have late updates, spin-off games, TLCS (remaking dinosaurs) and overall bad marketing choices (they made their game's first DLC while still in beta, which voilates steams rules of early access games. On top of that, they made there game 60$ before its final release, still broken as hell.) People have also reported bias within the dev team, reporting that no action against cheaters on PVP are taken because one of the devs has relations with said tribe. There was even a point in development where the team tried bribing their community with a new dinosaur (sheep) during the steam rewards season last year, where they said if they won they would release a sheep into the game called the Ovis. They got flamed for it and ended up losing and releasing the animal to the game anyway.\n\nIn short, a great way to sum up this dev team is Quantity over Quality. And i refuse to support a dev team that could care less about its player base and game.", "upvoted": false, "time_of_review_unix": 1537575571.0, "minutes_played": 204259, "upvotes_window": 206, "total_window": 290, "percent_window": 0.7103448275862069, "neu_sent": 0.815, "neg_sent": 0.106, "pos_sent": 0.08, "comp_sent": -0.9672, "neu_window": 0.6410274914089343, "neg_window": 0.10211340206185565, "pos_window": 0.2465601374570445, "comp_window": 0.3535164948453607, "percent_window_roc": 0.7579774177712322, "neu_window_roc": 0.8610872971905077, "neg_window_roc": 0.7903166421207658, "pos_window_roc": 0.7386710344606096, "comp_window_roc": 0.6586483390607102, "1day_forecast": 0.017570366760082834, "1day_delta": 0.006896551724137945, "classification": 0.0, "neg_predict": 0.005242220840156018, "pos_predict": 0.06847282512756532}, {"time_of_review": "2018-09-23T00:38:54", "review": "I like the game, I like the grinding aspect of it.

I have spent A LOT  of time playing ARK. There is ups and A LOT of downs. But I'm hoping wildcard can take this information and use it for good.\n\n-I haven't played in a while and wanted to see if it was worth playing agian so I log into ark and select \"my survivors\" well its all of the maps \"my survivor\" has been to and who knows what server they are on. So I decided not to play on the fact that I could not find my character. There should be a Character selector rather than a server selector and pray your character is on one of the servers. \"not likely\" one of the many problems that I don't have time to explain.\n\n-When you transfer your character to another map it does not save that 'map' or 'sever' to your favorites, so you better remember what server you transfered to.\n\n-The amount of time it takes to build a base and tame the animals is outrageous. Be prepared for hours and hours and hours of farming if you want any chance at this game. Go get a quetz, and a platform and farm all day long. Tame animals all day long. Then prepare yourself for your hundreds of hours to go right out the window when some bored alpha tribe member wipes your base with  everything you have poured your life and soul into. Yes there is pve but that is boring as shit. There should be some type of \"safe\" zone, so you can keep some dinos and equiptment. But maybe have higher level dinos in the pvp area but still have a HOME, But if you do not have a HUGE tribe with countless hours to spend maintaining and defending your base, you have no chance at this game, if you want to spend an hour or two a night on this game, don't even waste your time. You need a minimum of 3-4 hours a day. MINIMUM with maximum knowledge with knowledgable teammates to even have a chance. I have made some great friends on here, as well as been betrayed to the ends of the earth by whom I considered friends. If you have the willpower to suffer through a HUGE learning curve, the suffer to battle through sorrow and defeat day after day, kiss ass to the alpha tribes, lose all items and animals you care about and spend hundred or thousands of hours. Then buy this game, other wise keep on scrolling. This game could have been one of the greatest games of all time. But it lacks the true longevity of a game to fall in love with.

But recently, this game has kind of just fell into an absolute pit of despair.\n\n[h1]What's good[/h1]\n\n- So many dinosaurs, so many amazing concepts from the base game and first couple DLCs... really, when it comes to variety, there's pretty much something for everybody here.\n\n- You literally couldn't ask for a more creative, amazing, and invested modding community. Most mods make the game a lot more enjoyable than it actually is.\n\n[h1]What's bad[/h1]\n\n- The community... is so toxic - and that's not a recent developement. The game's always been filled with mega tribes and griefers, but after having them pole off entire sections of an island, or knocking you out before caging you for days at a time... you really gotta ask yourself if the game is worth it when fixes to such problems are either put off for ten billion years, or if they're considered part of the game and aren't fixed at all. I've made two friends off of this game since I started playing it. Two. I made more off of Garry's Mod, where the community is disgusting.\n\n- Wildcard pretty much all gathered together at a table, sat down, looked at each and collectively agreed, \"Let's put out more content instead of fixing bugs!\" Maybe if the content being shoved out were even remotely interested or enjoyable, it would be a different story. But the quality has dropped dramatically. Mod developers are coming out with much better content than the actual developers of the game - most of the content being fired is even buggier than what we already have. The truth of the matter is, the game isn't fun when dinos can fall through the map, when your model spazzes through platforms, items still vanish when dropped... along with the thousands of game breaking bugs that never got even remotely looked into. \n\n- The AI is so poorly programmed, it's laughable. While wild, dinos will aimlessly wander around, sometimes stopping or turning directions. If you get too close or hit them, they'll either run or attack you. Carnivores will go on murder sprees, leaving trails of bodies and bags as they rip everything they're able to chew on down. Excited to see flocks of birds flying in formation or resting on cliffsides? Afraid not. Herds of herbivores grazing? Nah. Packs of utahs tracking you down? Sorry, but no. And don't get me started on tames, who will literally find themselves stuck every two ft. on a small pebble.\n\n- The grind is real.

He was doing his thing and I was doing mine and he decided to steal some of their materials they had in a nest. It was very exciting.\nThe first time we built a large trap to capture a female Wyvern for its milk to feed a baby wyvern that hatched from an egg we stole. The trap was perfect for luring it in and getting it stuck but Wyverns are dangrous so my friend got on his slow tank bird and I was on my griffon incase things went wrong I could kill it if it was to close to killing my friend.\nGriffons have a very strong swooping attack where you manually fly up hight and then drop straight toward the ground at incredible speed and force with its claws.\n\nEvery creature in the game has its own attacks and special abilities and things it is good at and bad at. Some creatures can gather wood and thacth very quickly or berries, meat. some gather stone quickly or do combinations of things better than others. It will have you wanting to capture and tame every single dino in the game and breed them aswell. \n\nYou can form armies of wolfs or raptors if you want to. You can build defenses or you can explore and find the perfect spot for a camp that hardly needs protection. You can add every dino and item from all maps into one and it gives you so much to craft and look forward to if you want. \nIf there's something you want in the game that's not there you can probably find it in the workshop.\n\nThe graphics... if you can turn them up and run it omg they are amazing. such a beautiful world. \n\n Not to mention they have improved the animations for flying creatures so they don't look like robots now. The griffons are amazing creatures.\n\nJust don't base your thoughts of gettin the game off of the reviews because they are very mixed up. Some will say its the best game ever. Those are probly the one's that can run the game without issues and have friends they are playing with on their own private server. Some say its the worst game ever and theyre probly the ones that either can't run the game as good as they'd like or played on official servers and got banned or lost everything they worked for at some point somehow.\n\nI don't mean to talk bad on anyone that can't run the game that great. I'm just saying it might have something to do with some of the negative reviews because the game is pretty demanding but it is better than it used to be. They have a lot of options for running the game on older hardware though the game will look like crap IMO. \n\nBottome line is if you have the pc to run the game it's worth it.

Might be a while for that though.... \nA few things to know about \"ARK\"\nFirst.. if you dont have much time, then run your own server. You don't want your precious game hours destroyed by other people.\nIf you DO have alot of time, then a large public server may be up your alley, as you'll have more time to invest in defences, etc.\nSO! #1 rule.. Figure out your play style before you start. Figure out how much time you want to dedicate to your game/base, and if you are willig to deal with other people.. And if so, should it just be a group of friends on a private server? or on a pvp arena! This greatly effects your experience, so choose wisely.\n(Graphics):\nThe game is simply beautiful when ran on a good rig. The photos speak for themselves. \n\nGAMEPLAY:)\nIm basically a PVE player for now with a few friends running our own server, but I can tell you.. there is ALOT of content, and things to do that keep you busy for hours and hours... The progression seems pretty solid as you ascend through the tech tree. I've had moments of sheer terror playing this game, wandering the woods at night.. THings that get your heart pumping. :) .. And It feels great when you get your first tame.. or your first BIG tame. Then the base building.. staring at a cliff face and imagining what you can put there.. your great fortress... or maybe a log cabin in the woods.. (with some good dino defenses).. Overall, I've had tons of enjoyable hours playing ark. I believe I may be sticking with PVE, (Set to max hardness), but hey.. you never know.. I might change my mind later.. lol.\nMy rating for this game (10/10 PVE) ..

However, as the developers kept adding and adding stuff, I found I started losing interest.  I must say, the game is BEAUTIFUL (if you have a $3000 computer) Unlike me, who has a OK gaming computer, I can't play it that well, what with how resource intensive it is.  \n\nIn regards to the gameplay, it's next to impossible to get beyond mid range tech by yourself unless you spend 12 hours a day every day grinding.  While I don't oppose the multiplayer, I kind of wish the game was more singleplayer friendly.  Multiplayer servers are hit and miss, with most of them baren wastelands where the alpha tribes ride around in lvl 3 million giga's slaying anyone they choose.  You just have to find the right server...  \n\nI loved playing it though, the ambiance is awesome, that feeling of going out on a journey, head on a swivel.  Venturing out into the forest in the dead of night is kinda terrifying, and I remember walking on the beach in my first hours, and seeing this hulking mass approach me.  Being a noob, I stood there, until it was too late...\n\nIn the end, this game is not bad, but it is too resource intensive, and I feel like the game has gotten clunkier, what with the devs adding dinosuars everyday.  Collecting resources with only 1 or 2 people is a joke, unless you spend your life doing so, which makes it almost a requirement to play with others in a constantly online world, where anything can happen, even when your not online.  I recommend for someone who has lots of friends who play the game and have a very powerful computer.\n\nEDIT: I came back some time later, looked at the latest videos, and regreted ever paying for this game.

It was fun during early access, and the devs promised that they'd fix all worst bugs by release. Ark was promising, and I spent a lot of time online defending it. Life caught up with me around the time the game released and I had to quit, though.\n\nMy friend recently started playing and wanted me to join her, and oh boy. Ooooh boy.\n\nThe good: the devs continued to update the game, adding many new species to find and tame, new items, and maps.\n\nThe bad: the devs decided to add those species, it seems, at the cost of not fixing anything. The same bugs from 2015 are still around. I still lose my tamed dinos because they randomly sink into the earth. I still can't take more than two with me into the woods because they'll get stuck on the terrain. It seems like they never worked on optimizing the game, as it's still laggy as ever on a computer than can run most modern games on maxed out graphics, even on medium settings.\n\nThen there's the normal stuff that's working as intended, but still not great. Taming an animal can take over an hour, and raising them is even worse because the babies can't feed themselves, meaning you have to sit next to them and handfeed them for a few hours. The AI, when it's not getting stuck in trees, is simplistic- if a predator sees something smaller than it then the predator will attack regardless of context, running straight on at its target, and most herbivores wander aimlessly. Only one, as far as I know, even sleeps. The raptors, rexes, etc are just killbots with ADHD, running to whatever creature's closest to it and often switching targets when another creature gets their attention mid-rampage. \n\nThe game seems to be in the same state as it was before release, only with a few more maps and a higher cost. Although I will continue to play with my friend because we live far away from each other and this is one of the only ways we can actually do something together, I CANNOT recommend this game unless you\n1. buy it on sale\n2. have a group of friends ready to play\n3. plan to play on an unofficial server unless you have no school, job, or life outside the Internet in general", "upvoted": false, "time_of_review_unix": 1540339733.0, "minutes_played": 14708, "upvotes_window": 210, "total_window": 305, "percent_window": 0.6885245901639344, "neu_sent": 0.843, "neg_sent": 0.07, "pos_sent": 0.087, "comp_sent": 0.649, "neu_window": 0.6618006535947714, "neg_window": 0.07027450980392158, "pos_window": 0.2515686274509804, "comp_window": 0.38188888888888883, "percent_window_roc": 0.6872082166199813, "neu_window_roc": 0.8792154508155708, "neg_window_roc": 0.8072478991596638, "pos_window_roc": 0.6821004621994177, "comp_window_roc": 0.5736154110767113, "1day_forecast": -0.004818519876394478, "1day_delta": 0.005191256830601065, "classification": 1.0, "neg_predict": 0.000688706186735864, "pos_predict": 0.20837667983815056}, {"time_of_review": "2018-10-25T00:38:34", "review": "This game is a lot of fun.

Was it worth it? I'd say yes, i've had so many great memories with this game that it's hard to put down sometimes. Before this review starts i'd like you to take what I say with a grain of salt, as I may have some bias for this game.\n\nPVE: This is what ark was really inteded for, in my opinion. The story it's self is really facinating, and with extinction coming out soon it really makes me wonder what they'll do to end off this game. Pve is incredibly simple, survive. With that mindset you don't have to wonder if your neighbor is doing to foundation wipe you tommorow and destroy everything you worked for. Also really like this certain mode because it doesn't really see any dino as really useless. It's a blast going from your first thatch hut and raptor, to your metal base and wyverns. It just a lot more enjoyable, especially with other people. Thats not to say that PVE doesn't have it's problem either. Without raiding the game can feel a bit too dull or easy, which is why is suggest playing on a offline raid protection server. You can also meet very nice people who you can atually become very good friends, and ark neighbors with.\n\nPVP: This is my least favorite part of a game of all time. It may be because of arks horrible hit reg problem, and grinding galore. Simply staying up just to offiline raid a guy is the only way you can really raid, and if you do try to fight someone while they're online you'll most likely get bola-ed and then be knocked out. Even if you are good at the game, without wipes like rust, alpha tribes on pvp servers stay in power and annihilate your base when you start out. Even when you start the up again it only differs a little each time you get foundation wiped. So don't try and raid with a arthro and pt, it really won't last long. Raiding isn't reallyworth the trouble. \n\nI think ark can be a great game for some people who just wanna have some fun and tame up cool creatures. I have so many fun memories of just screwing around with my friends, and having a great time. Personally, if you want a good PVE expirience, this is definetly the game for you.\n", "upvoted": true, "time_of_review_unix": 1540948534.0, "minutes_played": 62314, "upvotes_window": 213, "total_window": 309, "percent_window": 0.6893203883495146, "neu_sent": 0.792, "neg_sent": 0.052, "pos_sent": 0.156, "comp_sent": 0.9932, "neu_window": 0.651796774193548, "neg_window": 0.08710000000000002, "pos_window": 0.24497096774193558, "comp_window": 0.3506825806451613, "percent_window_roc": 0.7668202764976959, "neu_window_roc": 0.8721250036315744, "neg_window_roc": 0.659447004608295, "pos_window_roc": 0.7436438548889559, "comp_window_roc": 0.6963780418788907, "1day_forecast": -0.004432928542440595, "1day_delta": -0.011337506387327556, "classification": 1.0, "neg_predict": 0.16236276016136508, "pos_predict": 0.025949307442609496}, {"time_of_review": "2018-11-01T00:57:27", "review": "Great Game!

Although compared to some this makes me still a relative newbie to ARK, I believe I have seen enough of the game to post a review. I will note, however, that my experience is limited to the base game  only, on the Island map only, and so I cannot comment on the DLCs or even the other maps like Ragnarok.\n\nThere's a lot to like about this game. I enjoy playing it, and I've been pretty darn addicted to it since I started my first character. This game really does encourage you to keep playing, in the sense that there are many things I have on my to-do list, and I can never get to them all.... Collect more resources to grow the base, build the base, tame more dinos, explore caves, etc. The depth and complexity of the game add to this. For example, you will be flying along on your Argentavis (which is a fun thing to do in and of itself), and see a Baryonix down there. Oh cool maybe you should tame it. But wait, you don't have prime fish meat. To get that, you'll need your pet ichthyornis, who is back at base. So now you fly back to the base to get him. When you return to the base you realize that your plants are running out of fertilizer, so you spend time gathering up animal dung and depositing it into compost bins. Then it is time to harvest and you are out of space in your cooling bin so you need to make another one. But you are out of wood so you have to take the beaver out to go get wood. Before you know it 2 hours have gone by and you forgot all about the Baryonix. And so it goes.\n\nI love that about this game, and because of the complexity and the sheer number of things to do, I could play for many more hours than I have -- and I will do so in the future. Overall it is a fun and enjoyable game, but there are some issues. I will mention all of those below. Please note that, I have only ever played single-player, hosting myself on my own computer. I cannot comment on official or unofficial multiplayer servers.\n\nThe Good\n- Beautiful graphics. Some of the best I have ever seen. Sunrises and sunets are gorgeous. The world is lovely.\n\n- Well-designed and fully functional \"pet\" system, with the abilty to finely control all your tamed dinosaurs.\n\n- Speaking of -- dinosaurs! I love dinosaurs and they do a great job with them. Each one has its own sounds, and they have many unique characteristics. A Raptor is not just a smaller version of a T-rex or a larger version of a Dilophosaur. All 3 of those dinos act completely differently. All of the dinos have their own traits and behaviors, likes and dislikes, as well as special uses.\n\n- Solid architectural building system, even without mods, that allows you to be creative.\n\n- Mods and tons of settings allow the user to tailor the game to taste. For example, I got tired of corpse runs so I found a mod that lets you just pull all your stuff off your corpse into your inventory after you rez. Even without mods, they let you customize everything from experience gain rate to taming speed.\n\nThe bad\n- Something broke with the post-400 series nVidia drivers and now if you upgrade past 399.07, many people get not just a game crash but a full PC crash (blue screen of death). This has been going on (at the time of this writing) for nearly 2 months without being addressed by either nVidia or the Arkdevs. Someone needs to step up here, because expecting people to live with BSODs or else months-old drivers is not reasonable.\n\n- In single-player, there is a years-old bug that causes resource nodes to become \"barren\" (not respawn) if you exit the game before the node respawns. There is a work-around (harvest when you first start to play and stop harvesting a good hour before you plan to stop the game), but it is massively annoying to have to walk on eggshells like this lest your crystal or obsidian nodes become sterile. That this persistent bug has never been addressed is highly disappointing (and rather lame).\n\n- Dinos and other animals can glitch to the point where even an admin command can't get them unstuck. This can happen to the player too, and if you are not an admin or playing solo you basically have to kill yourself (or wait to die) to get out because nothing can be done about it short of \"cheat ghost\" -- which non-admins (or non-single-players) cannot do.\n\nThere are some annoyances I have not experienced because as a SP player, I am a fully powered admin in my own game and I can just enter a cheat code to fix any bugged situations (at least to the extent possible). If I were playing on official I might have rage-quit this game already after being \"arked\" one time too often.\n\nOverall this is a good game. It is fun to play and is very engaging. There are some bugs, most of which can be worked around. However, it is disappointing that so many of the bugs requiring work-arounds have been around for months or sometimes even years without the arkdevs bothering to address them. I'd like to see better from them in that category.", "upvoted": true, "time_of_review_unix": 1541290649.0, "minutes_played": 21625, "upvotes_window": 216, "total_window": 319, "percent_window": 0.677115987460815, "neu_sent": 0.8, "neg_sent": 0.065, "pos_sent": 0.135, "comp_sent": 0.996, "neu_window": 0.6538093749999997, "neg_window": 0.09437812500000001, "pos_window": 0.23930937500000002, "comp_window": 0.3328574999999998, "percent_window_roc": 0.7821428571428571, "neu_window_roc": 0.8654777093965776, "neg_window_roc": 0.6654575892857143, "pos_window_roc": 0.7496105919003115, "comp_window_roc": 0.7124451754385965, "1day_forecast": 0.007899303059062612, "1day_delta": -0.004851225653939029, "classification": 1.0, "neg_predict": 0.24466001357880626, "pos_predict": 0.011825302345204658}, {"time_of_review": "2018-11-05T01:19:35", "review": "good", "upvoted": true, "time_of_review_unix": 1541380775.0, "minutes_played": 469, "upvotes_window": 222, "total_window": 325, "percent_window": 0.683076923076923, "neu_sent": 0.0, "neg_sent": 0.0, "pos_sent": 1.0, "comp_sent": 0.4404, "neu_window": 0.6512791411042942, "neg_window": 0.09303374233128836, "pos_window": 0.2403435582822086, "comp_window": 0.33349570552147223, "percent_window_roc": 0.7817703768624015, "neu_window_roc": 0.8657305512631849, "neg_window_roc": 0.6793382997370727, "pos_window_roc": 0.7549261319113965, "comp_window_roc": 0.7117102572381875, "1day_forecast": 0.0017715617715617915, "1day_delta": 0.00605828953655041, "classification": 1.0, "neg_predict": 0.18816726414998075, "pos_predict": 0.016770374722369502}, {"time_of_review": "2018-11-06T00:07:17", "review": "Great game if you have friends.

Been on this game  Since the begining.  also the Prequil  before this one that didnt pan out so good :(\nFrom Day 1,  this game has some AMAZING content,  AWESOME scenery and landscaping,  I can remember the FIRST time I came across a T rex,  In the dark  while gathering at night ,  To hear his food steps behind me,  and his ROAR<  I very nearly  Peed my pants IRL  I was so Immersed in the Game!!    the Story, or Premise behind the game is simple,  and works,  the ability to have a Survival game,  with dino and animal taming,  breeding  etc,  Is in my books  EPIC>   However IMO-  Wildcard Does Not QUITE pull it off well enough.\nSince Day 1,  Ark has had MULTIPLE issues  with Lag on servers,  with Glitches and bugs  falling through landscape,  Clipping with landscape, and Pets,  The ability to build bases on boats and hide them into sides of cliffs and rocks  so they are un attackable.  Clipping with pets wings  and faces  that get you stuck  at times  inside Your Trex  or Giga's  Mouth,   wing clipping that knocks you off of cliffs, or holds you stuck up in the air  unable to move or jump  without hitting your pets etc.\nSimple commands for pets  Like Land here,  FOllow  etc  that constantly screw up  years  after the release of the game IMO  are just Wild cards way of Ignoring certain things,    and not dealing with Glaring problems in the game.  But like a Good magician,  they wave their hands and say look over here,  new maps,  new expansion packs,  new dinos   and for a couple weeks,   Couple of months  they distract you from the glaring errrors and trash,  while you explore the new crap,  Only to be reminded  of the glaring errors and glitches  that have been Carried Over  into the new maps and expansions.\n\nSince DAY 1  this game has had ongoing issue's with Tribes,  pro player's and I am CERTAIN  Hacker's.  Who join a server and wipe out the entire community regardless of size and power,  I was just on a Pve Pvp server  where me and some friends heard it was pretty peaceful,  we friended some tribes, and made a HUGE base  inside a Hidden cavern,   Not exactly a cave,  It was on  Ragnarok and was a huge cavern behind some water falls,  apparently  cave bonus dmg  still applies etc.   2 guys  Joined the server with high lev Ptera, and Rexs  (not sure what else as i only killed one player once and his ptera).   They wiped out dozens and dozens of plant X species.  more than a dozen gun turrets,  more than 40 pets,  wyverns,  rexs,  griffins,  argents  pteras  all nearly / Maxed level tamed pets, 150+  and some Tek 150+s.   wiped everything out,  with one guy  dying one time.\nI can see  maybe one base,  but they wiped out the entire server  in one day,  approx  2 guys,  against metal bases,  gun turrets  Literally 100's   of pets   server wide.   Then came back next couple days  to gloat  each day,  and kill  more people  who were rebuilding etc,   How is it possible 2 guys wipe out entire servers?   and they do this over and over agian.\nI PERSONALLY  have put in 3-4 complaints  to wildcard  over the years,  with screen shots,  text and chat messages from in game,  including Profanity,  name calling,  N word and other racial slurs,  Used by the Raiders,   and I did not  EVEN ONE TIME   receive ANY  Response  from Wild card studios,,  not  even to say they got my email.\n\nThey just don't Care,..\n There Been Br's,  Chinese,  Russian's,  Latino's etc.  Its STILL ongoing.  It still happens on a daily basis,  and THAT  is EXACTLY what has completely ruined the game for a Large portion of its player base.    People come back  for a couple weeks,   couple months,   when new Xpacks  or content comes out,  and they leave again  very very quickly.\n\n\nPRO'S= \nStunning graphics, visuals,\nimmersive game play\nEndless things to do,  to try,  to learn.\n\nCONS=  Game over run with Griefer's ,  Hackers   who just wish  to ruin the experience for everyone else\nbecause their mama's  didn't breast feed them enough.\n\nWild card, does not awknowledge,  or care  that there are HUGE  Ongoing game glitches, bugs  that they have never been able to fix, or have never tried.\nas well as Not really doing anything Substantial  to rid servers of those  who ruin it for others  etc.\n\n\nP.S> Yes I know  there are PVE  servers  where you cannot attack each other, I have played and still play these,   as well as Hard core servers,.\nBut our tribe also enjoys some times where you have  \"Friendly\"  tribe wars  without griefing and wiping each other,  We still very much Enjoy  the pvp aspect of the game,   without having too Grief and wipe everyone out and drive them off of the servers.", "upvoted": false, "time_of_review_unix": 1542590594.0, "minutes_played": 200336, "upvotes_window": 713,

probably only achieveable by those with no jobs or families to take care of  (lets be honest, I'm right) and this direction has created a yucky taste in most peoples mouth in some way even if they don't admit it due to their religious fanboyism causing severe emotional biases which will interfere with their emotional judgment in so many ways.\n\nall in all, the game is great but it could be REALLY AMAZING, but its far from REALLY AMAZING in its current state and direction. In sort the developers need to consider (simplified) two different groups of people that play their game, 1. Extroverts and 2. Introverts, with this in mind, end game content or any content for that matter requires multiple methods to be able to obtain. Naturally one or more methods suitable for introvert personalities and one or more, suitable for extravert personalities.\n\nwe also need to consider the cons and pros of each gamer \"personality category\", 1. introverts are more analytical and have a bias towards using more of their brain then extraverts and tend to think about their decisions before making them more so then not and 2. extraverts more often then not have a heavy bias towards using less of their brain more so then not, and more so the rear parts of their brain more so then not, and also have a heavy bias towards impulsive decision making.\n\nso if the developers can structure end game or all content more heavily around the fact that not everyone is going to be one or the other then you may see a game just about anybody can love more so then not for years to come. A better game, suitable for more types of personalities.\n\n\nEdit:\n\nwith that said, you don't have to play the game the way the devs intended, you can make the game perfect for you by starting your own private server and mashing together your own personal favorite collection of mods and from that angle, the game is incredible and complete, almost.", "upvoted": true, "time_of_review_unix": 1543104172.0, "minutes_played": 201703, "upvotes_window": 2520, "total_window": 2974, "percent_window": 0.8473436449226631, "neu_sent": 0.784, "neg_sent": 0.082, "pos_sent": 0.135, "comp_sent": 0.9892, "neu_window": 0.6119327731092434, "neg_window": 0.0627963025210085, "pos_window": 0.3158588235294119, "comp_window": 0.4690809411764698, "percent_window_roc": 0.7928931572629052, "neu_window_roc": 0.8444901346909223, "neg_window_roc": 0.6986074429771908, "pos_window_roc": 0.8314353778894735, "comp_window_roc": 0.7208904614477369, "1day_forecast": 0.01812143393153709, "1day_delta": 0.028728767678251277, "classification": null, "neg_predict": 0.0018522491959197089, "pos_predict": 0.7373761822032057}, {"time_of_review": "2018-11-26T00:02:53", "review": "I Enjoyed the game\nits ragey but its fun as fuck\nstill good", "upvoted": true, "time_of_review_unix": 1543190573.0, "minutes_played": 12947, "upvotes_window": 2689, "total_window": 3107, "percent_window": 0.8654650788542002, "neu_sent": 0.345, "neg_sent": 0.205, "pos_sent": 0.45, "comp_sent": 0.6908, "neu_window": 0.6103828828828838, "neg_window": 0.060362612612612734, "pos_window": 0.3205698198198203, "comp_window": 0.48546959459459366, "percent_window_roc": 0.8189005331862474, "neu_window_roc": 0.8389039315938146, "neg_window_roc": 0.6714527027027026, "pos_window_roc": 0.8549938456480513, "comp_window_roc": 0.7536577931314773, "1day_forecast": 0.010695911857874107, "1day_delta": 0.01778518645339322, "classification": null, "neg_predict": 0.00448377712946149, "pos_predict": 0.6663221738002791}, {"time_of_review": "2018-11-27T00:09:26", "review": "Fun game even though its sometimes broken and can be poorly opitimized its still fun to play everyonce and a while.", "upvoted": true, "time_of_review_unix": 1543277366.0, "minutes_played": 68684, "upvotes_window": 2831, "total_window": 3231, "percent_window": 0.876199319096255, "neu_sent": 0.569, "neg_sent": 0.11, "pos_sent": 0.32, "comp_sent": 0.7096, "neu_window": 0.610021349009902, "neg_window": 0.05914387376237638, "pos_window": 0.32310210396039646, "comp_window": 0.4971011757425733, "percent_window_roc": 0.8373408769448373, "neu_window_roc": 0.8352818817231469, "neg_window_roc": 0.6509624734794908, "pos_window_roc": 0.8703849356898307, "comp_window_roc": 0.7778031092582942, "1day_forecast": 0.007823634694140602, "1day_delta": 0.010734240242054827, "classification": null, "neg_predict": 0.009160642289075394, "pos_predict": 0.5841320811618007}, {"time_of_review": "2018-11-28T00:33:03", "review": "I like it", "upvoted": true, "time_of_review_unix": 1543365183.0, "minutes_played": 2184, "upvotes_window": 2927, "total_window": 3311, "percent_window": 0.8840229537903956, "neu_sent": 0.286, "neg_sent": 0.0, "pos_sent": 0.714, "comp_sent": 0.3612, "neu_window": 0.6097285628019332, "neg_window": 0.058059178743961465, "pos_window": 0.3246642512077297, "comp_window": 0.5044741545893708, "percent_window_roc": 0.8485162180814355, "neu_window_roc": 0.8330247840154775, "neg_window_roc": 0.6403823757763975, "pos_window_roc": 0.8804009210348096, "comp_window_roc": 0.7925194931773879, "1day_forecast": 0.003181412492199831, "1day_delta": 0.007204631289621899, "classification": null, "neg_predict": 0.01285581458777334, "pos_predict": 0.5398595589727943}, {"time_of_review": "2018-11-29T00:25:45", "review": "Great game, all the hate on it was from years past.
