Not something I \n     can play for more than 2 hours at a time.\n     But when I need to relax I start up \n     this game.\n3. Big price tag. Small company\n     The game is expensive. About the same price\n     GTA V was on release. And in my opinion,\n     while I recommend this game to everyone,\n     you can get an almost equal experience with\n     stopping by your local second hand game store\n     and picking up an old ps2 or xbox. The company\n     is really cool though. So if you can afford it,\n     get it. Don't skip buying food for this super\n     overhyped game that had horrible misrepresentation\n     on mainstream media and leave bad reviews because\n     you didn't do any research.\n4. Everything is randomized... almost\n     I'm pretty sure everything is randomized except\n     for alien civilizations and the main platform for\n     landing in space stations. Just a heads up for \n     anyone who cares about that sort of thing.\n     (music is very cool.... and it is also randomized)\n5. Monotonous\n     At times this game can be monotonous. But for\n     me it did not effect my high appreciation for\n     what it is. A survival game. Minecraft was \n     monotonous for me at times. The game needs\n     base building to make the monotony worth \n     doing. But Hello Games said they might be\n     making add on content with this feature.\n     So fear not!!\n6. Mods are happening\n     I noticed a few mods are popping up on the\n     internet. Whether you want the ability to \n     play user created content or the possibility\n     of other players being able to cheat, that\n     is on you as a buyer to decide. I think it's\n     fine as this at the moment is a single player\n     game. Hello Games has been on top of sensoring\n     offensive planet names. So I imagine if modding\n     interferes with the gameplay of others vanilla\n     games they company will do something about it.\n     Too early to say now though.\n7. Weak storyline, but open to interpretation\n     Hello games did an excellent job at leaving it's\n     story content open ended for the user to fill in\n     their own blanks. For those of you who have no\n     imagination this game might be difficult for you.\n     A game for the young at heart. And also for geeks.\n     I am a geek. <3 Science!\n8. Too unusual to fit into a genre\n     No Man's Sky is one of the most ususual games\n     I've ever played. It does not have the perks \n     the pokemon and mario games had with piggybacking\n     off original firsties. It is the first game of\n     its' kind. And that is why I believe that there\n     are so many mixed reviews. Not because the devs\n     lied or the game sucks. But because it's\n     un-placeable in the video game industry.\n     It transcends what we precieve video games to be.\n     I support Hello Games because they had the\n     guts to invest in something that was new and\n     possibly a bit scary for everyone involved.\n\n\nI give this game the following ratings out of 10\n\n\nBeauty/Athmosphere               10\n\nControls (keyboard)              10\n\nControls (360 controller)        4\n\nDifficulty                       Mixed\n\nStory                            Mixed\n\nMusic                            10\n\nReplayability                    7\n\nGame Stability as of\n 8/25/16                         6\n(on expirimental build)\n\nCan my mom play it?              3\n\nReward for work done in-game     3\n\nCustomization of content         2\n(without mods installed)\n\nSuspence                         8\n\nQuality of procedural \ngeneration                       10\n(planets, species, ships ect..)\n\nRealism of survival mechanics    6\n\nEase of managing gamesaves       0!\n\n\n\n\nVerdict:\n     If you've read this far chances are you\n     will be as much in love with this \n     terrifying beast of a game as I am.\n\n", "upvoted": true, "time_of_review_unix": 1472256019, "upvotes_window": 10064, "total_window": 21786, "percent_window": 0.46194804002570455, "neu_sent": 0.739, "neg_sent": 0.087, "pos_sent": 0.173, "comp_sent": 0.9967, "neu_window": 0.7450748611557348, "neg_window": 0.10207146463487336, "pos_window": 0.15184233717354456, "comp_window": 0.29554856565842136, "percent_window_roc": 0.525992777856648, "neu_window_roc": 0.9921721254952001, "neg_window_roc": 0.530365673249044, "pos_window_roc": 0.5392894845550099, "comp_window_roc": 0.4488485312177118, "1day_forecast": -0.09986363723217506, "1day_delta": 0.0026698060168143245, "pos_predict": 0.013411474858906522, "neg_predict": 0.4730072946317095}, {"time_of_review": "2016-08-28T00:00:20", "review": "1.

The marketting leading up to this game's release was unrepresentative, as are some of the Steam Store screenshots and videos. My review will instead intent to focus on the game without consideration of the events leading up to its release.\n\n\nThis is ultimately a huge space exploration game. All planets and animals are procedurally generated, meaning theoretically no two are identical and there are billions upon billions of planets to explore and animals to find. Any planet or animal you find first you get the option to name it and upload your finding, meaning any other player who comes across it will see your chosen name(s). This is unfortunately the extent of the positives.\n\nThe game has a massive, practically endless explorable environment, however once you've visited two star systems you will have seen most of the constituent parts that exist- meaning any new planet will just be the same parts in different configurations, and any new animals will be the same legs you've already seen, on another body you've already seen, etc.\n\nFor even less variety you only have to look as far as space stations. They all have identical interiors. And the space ships- they all handle the same, and their technologies don't differ by ship- only by the blueprints you know and materials you have to hand. The only differences between ships are aesthetics and inventory slots.\n\nThat brings me nicely onto inventory- for an exploration game the inventory is TINY. You get barely enough space to store the parts required to craft many things. And with the limited life support duration and running speed you are not encouraged to venture far from your ship. Combine that with the heavy materials cost to simply take off it very quickly becomes a grind.\n\nFinanlly the actual flight- the main reason many are even looking at this game. It's... so so. Once you get into a planet's atmosphere you are restricted from flying too low by an invisible barrier. The landing and taking off are both automatic one-button actions.\n\nTo conclude this is a fun little experience for a few hours, but after that it quickly becomes a grind with little-to-no payoff (as there is no story or direction). At the current \u00a340 price point is it NOT worth it. If you get the chance to grab it for \u00a320 or under I'd recommend it. I think the best thing about it I heard recently was that it's as vast as an ocean but deep as a puddle. You can fly across a massive universe, but don't epxect to be able to actually do much.", "upvoted": false, "time_of_review_unix": 1472688197, "upvotes_window": 2404, "total_window": 14986, "percent_window": 0.16041638862938742, "neu_sent": 0.906, "neg_sent": 0.034, "pos_sent": 0.06, "comp_sent": 0.9152, "neu_window": 0.7469196637085469, "neg_window": 0.13202255287916184, "pos_window": 0.12012971241742851, "comp_window": 0.10480365650230136, "percent_window_roc": 0.4019800105828152, "neu_window_roc": 0.9983415764201129, "neg_window_roc": 0.560978489049484, "pos_window_roc": 0.5014012143858011, "comp_window_roc": 0.41388729944849084, "1day_forecast": -0.02021439676517084, "1day_delta": -0.023966771678873205, "pos_predict": 0.0020143219236703667, "neg_predict": 0.5702884094559575}, {"time_of_review": "2016-09-02T00:01:54", "review": "Good experience at the beginning... but then it got repetitive.

One example that springs to mind is, leave a massive space station, fly down to the surface of a planet and then look back and see that same space station hanging in the sky over the planet, stunning.

The world is too saturated with technology that it doesn\u2019t take long before you find the same one over and over and over and over again. Hello Games should have spent more time developing more resources, foliage, lighting, technology, and rewards than writing an algorithm that generates so many planets. I would rather have 100 well developed and individually customized planets than 18 quintillion planets each as hollow and similar as the last. Get your priorities straight. I'm just waiting for Hello Games to announce DLCs for 20 to 40 bucks a pop just to make the game what it should have been from release.

I had a total of around the 2 hour limit in the end and unknowingly left the computer on overnight. It wasn't until a month later after playing around once a week that I had gained 68 hours on the game. I found out about the 68 hours when I was trying to refund the game, I didn't get the refund do to the playing hours on the game and the algorithm overlooking me. I was angry because I was also not enjoying the game, hence why I was refunding it. I was playing the game for a good amount of time keeping my eye on the limit in case of a refund and realized it was not what I had payed for. I was looking for a fun multiplayer experience with my friends or at least some of what the game had promised, instead I had gotten 18 quintillion of the same planet and even more of the same animal.

I'll update this review once I've put more time into the game (more like 50 to 80 hours).\n\nFirst of all, I completely agree with many of the criticisms leveled at No Man's Sky. However, I'm not convinced that the game was ever going to offer many of the things people were expecting; nor do I feel that Hello Games overly over-promised on what the game would offer. They may, and I stress \"may\", have over-promised slightly, but every game does (I know, it's already been said a thousand times). Most of the expectations for No Man's Sky were entirely in people's heads. Granted, Hello Games could have spent a bunch of time and energy squelching the speculation and hype, but what company in their right minds would do that!? None. Not a single one. 15 people made this game. What were you expecting? A cheaper game? This is probably the most valid criticism out there. But not for lack of content. More for the lack of resources put into it. The game seems plenty large enough to warrant the price tag (which, I'm sure is why they [read Sony] charged so much), but the price is too high relative to the amount of work that went into it. It sounds like Hello Games is fully conscious of this and will be adding content in the future (in addition to paid DLC) to help compensate for the price. It would've been better if more was available at launch, but a game shipping \"content complete\" seems more and more a thing of the past.\n\nAnyways, that being said, I'm still in awe of this game. It has delivered pretty much exactly what I was expecting/hoping for, and perhaps a bit more (didn't expect combat at all). While playing, I FEEL like I'm exploring unknown worlds. Because I am! Not even the developers have seen the planet I'm on. That's kinda cool. No, really cool! New sensations? Priceless. On top of this, the planets are gorgeous. At least I think so. Some have said the topography is too flat. Perhaps flatter than Earth, but I would say far from flat. I\"ve seen huge canyons hundreds of feet deep with bodies of crystal clear water at their bases, intricate caves along the shoreline, and huge spires of rock jutting up here and there. Breathtaking! \n\nMany of the planets I've come across so far have been teeming with life. Most of them hilariously strange. I've really enjoyed feeding dozens of them, then wrapping back around to see what they've shit out. And occasionally chased off by an oddly aggressive predator. It's been a hoot. Unlike any other game I've ever played.\n\nCollecting resources gives me something to do while I explore. Walking around shooting stuff, pretty much the same thing I do in every shooter. Most of the targets are non-aggressive, unlike most shooters, but strangely satisfying. Especially when you come across huge deposits of a particulary valuable resource. Pressing a button and seeing numbers go up. Who doesn't like that? A cheap reward, but rewarding nonetheless.\n\nThe alien races seem interesting. The language system is a neat idea. The space stations, settlements, monoliths, ships, and outposts have a cool aesthetic to them. I'm greatly intrigued by this game, but again, I'm only 10 hours in. I've gotten one new multi-tool, which was exciting. I've almost earned enough money to buy a large ship. Looking forward to that! And have the entire Universe left to explore. Can't wait! Actually, writing this has been difficult, because I'd rather be playing, but, again, I feel I need to put my two cents in for those who are enjoying this game. Most of the people who do are probably too busy playing to say so, or are just too non-confrontational to care enough to counter all the nay-sayers. This is a cool game. And I'm grateful it exists.\n\nThanks, Hello Games.\n\n  \n*will say more when I'm deeper in*\n\n\nUpdate (30 hrs in):\n\nOkay, I was totally wrong about this game, like so many others still seem to be. No Man's Sky aint no hippy dippy, tree-hugging stroll through the universe. It gets downright brutal! All right, all right, most of it is pretty hippy dippy, at least so far. But some planets? Are pure evil incarnate. Especially, apperently, the ones with the richest resources. Like ten times richer.  If you don't have the right tech on your suit, forget about it. The planet will suck you dry of life in seconds, forcing you to constantly recharge the little protection you have. What? You don't have any Titanium or Zinc? You better F'n find some. And find some F'n fast. Oh! Whew, there's some. 30 seconds. Shit! Need some more. Wait, what the F was that? Why is that Sentinel attacking? Oh, shit! They're overly sensitive on this planet. I can't even harvest a single plant without pissing them off. Great! Well, I'd better kill this little bugger before he calls his cronies. \"Environmental Protection Zero.\" Shit! That's right. Recharge shields. Damn it! More sentinels. Where's some Zinc!? Over that ridge, thank God. Almost there. WTF!? Giant crabs? No, spiders. No, giant F'n spider crabs! Grab the Zinc and run. Where's the ship? Oh, yeah, that's right, on a little island of rock in the middle of the ocean. That's what sent you to the main land of this god-forsaken planet in the first place. No Plutonium to take off. Where the F is the plutonium? All the little red lightning bolt symbols on my scanner are nothing but Thamium. Useless! What the? Damn spider crab. Get off me! \"Environment Protection zero\" Where's some Zinc? There we go. Shit! Pissed off the Sentinels. \"Severe storm incoming.\" Cave, cave, cave? Where the f... ah, cave. F you, spider crabs. Suck it, Sentinals. Got me a little hidey hole. Oh, sweet. Red crystals. Plutonium! I'm saved. Okay, okay, where's the ship, scanner? Oh, yeah. On an island. Through the crabs. Against the Sentinals. In a blizzard. \"Environmental Protection zero.\" F. U. C. K! Gotta get off this rock. But I'll be back. Look at all those Gravatino Balls. Just lyin' about. Papa needs a new ship.\n\n\nUpdate (43 hrs. in):\n\nDecided to stop playing No Man's Sky until some of these features Sean claims Hello Games is working on come out. The silence from them has me a little concerned, but I have faith. I don't think the features coming are going to change the minds of the naysayers, though I'm sure they'll make for a better game.

and I wish I could take it all back.  I've still got some hope that Hello Games will do something with their flagship title.  If you are reading the reviews for this game I am sure you are no doubt aware of the many flaws, lies and bugs with this game.  Instead of boring you with more of the same kind of hype train meltdown, I'll focus on the TWO things that did it for me.\n\n1. Ships\n\nOr lack thereof.  There is quite litterally, absolutely NO difference between any of the ships except for cosmetics.  I know Sean Murray explicitly mentioned ship variety in several videos, but none of that exists, period.  Each ship has \"slots\" and its very easy to spend a dozen hours on a single planet finding all the crashed ships.  (And why does every single planet have dozens, even hundreds of crashed ships?  more on that later).  \n\nEvery crashed ship you find has a chance to have 1 extra slot than the ship you are currently flying, and you hop off your current ship and into your new one.  That's No Man's Sky's ship progression.  Use use these slots evenly for engine/weapon upgrades and for storing items.  Slots are what matter, the more slots you have the more upgrades you can fit.  Once you hit 30 or so slot ships you can fit all upgrades.\n\n2. Life\n\nEVERY SINGLE PLANET has way too much life, there's abandoned structures, yes, but there's too much \"signs of life\" too many crashed ships, too many outposts, too many structures for life to matter in this game.  All planets have the same \"algorithm\" that generate all these structures, crashed ships, outposts, satellites, etc.  There's no difference between barren planets and lush planets, each have the same \"signs of life\" ALL OVER the planet.\n\n18 quintillion plannets, and every single one of them is generated with the same ruleset, there's just too much life for it to matter in this game, there's just too much of everything for it to matter.\n\nAnd that's the main point that's the main problem of the game for me, each planet has everything, and when each planet has everything you could discover, it all becomes moot and nothing is special anymore.  The Taj Mahal is special because there's only one, but this game is like, \"no, every state and country get's a Taj Mahal\" instantly making the Taj Mahal no longer special and no longer matter.", "upvoted": false, "time_of_review_unix": 1478131982, "upvotes_window": 106, "total_window": 922, "percent_window": 0.11496746203904555, "neu_sent": 0.839, "neg_sent": 0.083, "pos_sent": 0.078, "comp_sent": -0.7731, "neu_window": 0.6835590465872153, "neg_window": 0.19728927410617547, "pos_window": 0.11155471289274103, "comp_window": 0.004405525460455038, "percent_window_roc": 0.10409433344251555, "neu_window_roc": 0.9262222709926814, "neg_window_roc": 0.990082506875573, "pos_window_roc": 0.371614301191766, "comp_window_roc": 0.005661667848819536, "1day_forecast": 0.005382647370144822, "1day_delta": 0.0016561309059322377, "pos_predict": 0.21115987185711, "neg_predict": 0.0009236765282886163}, {"time_of_review": "2016-11-04T00:06:14", "review": "Months have passed now, and rather than complete the content they led people to expect or even flesh out the game further, it has instead been abandoned.

After maxing out my ship, exosuit, and multitool, I couldn't find any other purpose to continue playing.  I traveled around a bit, looking for cool ships and naming systems and planets along the way, hoping to find something more to the game.  I never did.\n\nThe procedural generation severely lacks diversity on all fronts.  There are four ship 'classes' that pretty much serve the same purpose.  A fighter-like, a transport-like, a round-cockpit, and a box.  The fauna are composed of Terran species parts glued together, and you see the same really angry crab creatures everywhere.  The flora starts to look the same after the first few planets you visit.  Terrain lacks diverse biomes ; you won't see any deserts, marshes, rivers, or snow-capped peaks.  There's so many opportunities for rare features, like huge lootable capital ship wreckages, massive underground installations, and actual working portals.  There are functionally 5 climates, none of which are a threat to your safety.  Star systems are laid out in similar manners, with one star, a space station, and then 1+ planets, possibly with moons.  NPC interactions and terminals give no feeling of depth.  The ancient monoliths do have some interesting text but, unless everyone is wrong about this game, there's no relation between that content and the true gameplay.\n\nDon't bother grinding things like I did.

Each player's \"universe\" is unique to them. When that dickhead was asked if there would be multiplayer his answer should have irrefutably been \"NO\". Furthermore, \"NO ABSOLUTELY NOT\". I haven't seen or read anybody else make this argument. And what pisses me off even more is that he used the excuse that \"the game is just so damn big it could take years for anybody to ever bump into another player\". I recall a long winded story of an exciting space battle wherein an enemy spacecraft is using techniques you have never experienced before and then he kills you. That was when you were to realize \"Ermahgerd! Thert wers anerther plerrer!\"\n\nAll of this, and I don't give a damn about multiplayer at all! I'm pissed that the game is a boring grinding simulator with uninspired environments and a dull soundtrack. And with a budget estimation I sourced from Reddit (about tree fitty) they could have hired John Williams or even Danny Elfman to compose a bad ass soundtrack. Some synth sounds and string chords don't make for a compelling experience, personal tastes aside. I found the game much more enjoyable (still only to keep playing out of hope that it would get good at some point) listening to silent movie era music and 80s action movie trailers. Seriously, try playing a boring game while listening to all of Sylvester Stallone's movie trailers. Its hilarious.\n\nThe game was pitched to us as a space exploration game that was so expansive and so engrossing that one could possibly never get bored of it and always find something new but I find the expression \"a mile wide and an inch deep\" to be much more fitting. \n\nI pre-ordered the game (like a fool) and returned it before installing after reading the initial reviews only to repurchase the game three days later after hearing about people's race to the center of the galaxy. Galaxy? I thought it was supposed to be a universe. Whatever. Regretted my decision the next day. I tried to get a refund but steam said I had played more than the allowed 2 hours. Frustrated, I kept at it in hopes of a better time. It never got better. Then I heard rumors from all over that in light of the vastly negative feedback, steam was allowing refunds for people who had gone over the 2 hour limit such as myself. I still don't know if that rumor was true or not but I was  not allowed a refund.\n\nAnd so, the games on my hard drive, wasting space. And even with this new update I will not reopen the game. For me, and for many like me, this is too little, too late.\n\nBush did Harambe and I'm going to bed.\ufeff", "upvoted": false, "time_of_review_unix": 1483747313, "upvotes_window": 225,

I got home, and began playing the game.\n\nThe tutorial had me scared out of my mind, stranded on the planet running out of life support and struggling with radioactivity. I didn't wanna go anywhere that I wouldn't be able to see my ship in fear of being eaten by a giant space worm or being attacked by a giant robot or something, but I got my ship into the air. I've now been to tons of planets, tons of galaxies and have a bit over 1 million credits, and I still use the beta ship. \n\nTo be completely honest: I enjoyed this game, I enjoy this game, and I will continue to enjoy this game. I played it a ton when it was first released, and I started playing it again about a month ago because of the new release. \n\nTrue, it would be much better and I would enjoy it a lot more if I could have my friend flying through space with me,  but that doesn't make it so I stop playing. \n\nTrue, I felt like I was running out of ideas, doing the same thing over and over again, but the new update changed everything.\n\nI now have a new purpose for playing this game, a reason to keep going. Sure, there's always the end goal of reaching the center (and the goal of avoiding spoilers for those who actually TRIED reaching it, instead of following the atlas storyline like I have been. Before the update, there was always the goal of collecting all the resources I needed from a planet by landing on it once at a random station, and items marked as \"rare\" were found everywhere, such as plutonium, so I could waste whatever I wanted on whatever I wanted to do because I could just land at any planet and collect 200 plutonium in about 12 seconds. After that, I would craft a few warp thingies and started off towards the next atlas objective.\n\nNow, after playing the new update for a bit, I still haven't chosen a planet for a house. I now have the goal of finding the perfect planet with all the materials that I want in the right galaxy that has no atmospheric issues, other than life support dropping but that happens anyway. \n\nI've also been collecting more money, as I've found the type of ship that I want that usually has the same specific price. Every now and then when I think I have enough money I'll wait at a station for a bit, but realize I either don't have enough for the perfect ship or that I'm in an empty galaxy with not too much commotion, which is perfectly fine with me because it means less pirates.\n\nThere's also the endgoal of getting a frigate. That is going to come much later for me and once I get my perfect ship and find a home, I can start grinding for money for a frigate, which I will take with me to the center of the galaxy (assuming I ever finish the atlas storyline).\n\nAfter all this ranting and my story, if you're still here, well, yes. I would recommend this game.\n\nThe game was released as a sort of \"pre-release\", almost enough to the point where it could have been an early access game and no one would hate on it constantly, but there is more coming. I almost gave up on it but eventually went back when the new update came because I knew it meant they were still going, still working on it.\n\nSure, maybe they'll even make a way for multiplayer to work.\n\nTL:DR = If you're fine with grinding for stuff, then you'll have fun. The way you have to look at this game though, is a game about exploration. Sure, grinding is a big part of it, but if you look at it in the sense that you're looking for some cool, new planets and cool new creatures (although a lot of them look like demented kangoroos), you won't really run out of excitement. Most of the planets before the update were just either deserts or snowstorms, but I believe the update contained something about terrain reformations, and there seem to be different types of planets now.\n\nAnyway, I enjoyed the game but don't have very many hours into it because I've been busy a lot, but making this review made me remember what I enjoyed about this game.\n\nIf you do purchase it, congratulations, there's more to come and you could really enjoy it. If you don't decide to purchase it, maybe check back on it in a while, they might've added another update.", "upvoted": true, "time_of_review_unix": 1484845022, "upvotes_window": 94, "total_window": 237, "percent_window": 0.39662447257383965, "neu_sent": 0.783, "neg_sent": 0.044, "pos_sent": 0.172, "comp_sent": 0.999, "neu_window": 0.7031806722689073, "neg_window": 0.14206722689075632, "pos_window": 0.1463403361344537, "comp_window": 0.20814033613445374, "percent_window_roc": 0.4613640805159273, "neu_window_roc": 0.9458637169016172, "neg_window_roc": 0.6399482870071106, "pos_window_roc": 0.5294117647058824, "comp_window_roc": 0.4098603470165044, "1day_forecast": -0.009667950834709227, "1day_delta": -0.03252532499701055, "pos_predict": 0.06814075364607457, "neg_predict": 0.022104836885026218}, {"time_of_review": "2017-01-20T00:01:39", "review": "If you want a chill game to relax and play..this isn't bad, 60 might be a bit much for you so wait for a sale..

Odd.\n\nSeriously, I want to like this game due to the hate for it. All I will say about Sean was he was too ambitious for his own good. It's basically an indie game with a AAA price. I got stuck and could not find the resources I needed to get my ship off the ground. It's basicallly a mining game in space as you build stuff, mine stuff, that sort of thing. If you like relaxing games, this one is definitely a good one to get on sale. But for those looking for complexity and challenge, this is not for you. NMS has no tutorial and it's extremely hard to find what you're looking for (Except Iron. IRON IS EVERYWHERE) I instantly forgot how to craft stuff also as I am writing this review. \n\nSo it's forgettable but inoffensive. It looks alright. But I can't figure out a lot. If you can figure out how to get your ship off the ground, then good. I can't. If you REALLY want this game, wait until a sale when it's like 30-40 dollars. Nice try Hello Games, but Go back to Joe Danger. I think that's what you were best at to begin with.\n\nI'll update on more soon.\n\nEDIT: I refunded the game. Maybe if it's a free PS Plus monthly game I'll give it another shot. But  with the price being too high, I feel it's best to wait.", "upvoted": false, "time_of_review_unix": 1486082903, "upvotes_window": 62, "total_window": 177, "percent_window": 0.3502824858757062, "neu_sent": 0.766, "neg_sent": 0.048, "pos_sent": 0.185, "comp_sent": 0.9913, "neu_window": 0.6741629213483147, "neg_window": 0.1664662921348314, "pos_window": 0.1481460674157304, "comp_window": 0.0837601123595506, "percent_window_roc": 0.41520773451789916, "neu_window_roc": 0.9184088711863081, "neg_window_roc": 0.7986171132238548, "pos_window_roc": 0.47191011235955055, "comp_window_roc": 0.2740077600840676, "1day_forecast": -0.0036915767847970904, "1day_delta": 0.005649717514124297, "pos_predict": 0.06661110958558776, "neg_predict": 0.0006528191551829496}, {"time_of_review": "2017-02-04T01:34:07", "review": "Just don't.

That being said it isnt worth the $60 price tag. Simply put the content the game has at this time is not $60 of content.\n\nNow that's out of the way I would like to point out a flaw in the game right now that completely ruined the illusion of a universe for me. Sometimes I will mark locations on a map with m \"F\" key, you know the visor thingy. If you didnt know if you use the visor on like Alien outposts and stuff it will mark them and make them easier to spot. So I spent like nearly 10 hours on a planet and marked tons of locations while trying to get the 10 for extreme survival. When I finally finished the achievement I was sick of this cold winter planet and quickly departed. I went to a new system I had never been and hence to a new planet as well. Although something was off... On this new planet I had never been there were locations EVERYWHERE that were marked in the way that your visor marks them.\n\nSo what can we learn from this? Well first of all we learn that the worlds in NMS are not completely procedurely generated. We learn that they are PRE CONFIGURED to be a certain layout then have wallpaper put over them randomly. So are all worlds really one world then? You decide. This also points to the FACT that this game has literally a fraction of the work that a typical triple AAA title takes to make. The develpoers designed small things like the parts of animals, a grass blade, a tree branch, a rock, the color of a surface, you get the picture. They designed all the small quirks of the game and then said F*** IT! Lets just use an algorithm to put a bunch of random shit together and make something out of it. Now this COULD BE really amazing if there was extemely expansive parts to deal with when building the worlds, but it seems to me that is just simply not the case. The parts avaliable seem like they could only successfully build a few unique planets. Overally I wouldnt recomend the game not because it wont entertain you, to many it will, but I wouldnt recomend this game simply do to the fact that it isn's worth $60. The game is fun but not $60 fun. Hell I have more fun with Teraria sadly. The one saving grace that the future may hold for this game is cool mods that can actually input substantial content in the future.\n\nUpdate on thoughts of No Man's Sky and why it it was a successful failure. (02/16/2017)\n\nThinking back at the game now, if it would have initially started with content that was actually achievable and interesting, (The alien language discovery style was a drag) that kept players wanting to achieve these things instead of like how the achievements are where I did them out of complete boredom, which is in partial because the achievements were not difficult, they were too easy, but one in particular took too long(Extreme Survival) to actually complete and at the same time it was still easy to complete, which gave the achievement itself very little value at completion so I just felt as if I wasted literally 20 hours of my life trying to get the one achievement. That also goes with beating the game itself. I won't spoil anything but No Man\u2019s Sky itself offered no real challenge to most individuals for the most part. There was nothing in the game that took me a few tries to complete. I could start doing something in the game and complete it with ease. With all that being said that in my opinion is the largest failure the game had. It was not challenging so upon completion nearly no one felt satisfied with the game itself because there was no value, in the eyes of the player, to its completion due to it not challenging anyone playing it. No Man\u2019s Sky was a good game, just not a game that offered meaningful challenges that made you feel satisfied upon completion. That's it for my rant I just wanted to say that as I thought about No Man\u2019s Sky more.\n\nIn the end list of mistakes:\n1. They chose to attempt to create a universe. Attempting to create an entire universe sets it up from the get go with unreal expectations.\n2. Instead of downplaying the universe, they themselves made it out to be better than it could ever possibly be. which goes on to one of their next failures.\n3. They chose to feed the hype. Instead of addressing much of the hype and claims about the game, and discrediting them, they chose to feed into it. This in my opinion is direct evidence of their intention of wrongdoing consumers.\n4. $60 price tag. Another example of evidence pointing to the fact this game was just one huge cash grab is the $60 price tag. They knew the game was extremely hyped and they knew it would sell a lot of copies. Instead of being humble in the success of the hype and good press the game had received pre release, they went for it all. The game even today is still not a $60 game. The fact they did this and to this day still have never really addressed the dissatisfied fans is the home run that shows that in fact they never cared about what people were going to think of the game, they just wanted the cash.\n5. The selling points they used for this game set it up for immense failure. One example is they chose to sell the idea that the universe is so expansive it could never ever fully be explored. This set it up for failure in two ways. One being that because the universe in the game could never really be fully explored, some players felt like they could never actually beat the game, which is not a feeling you want player playing your game to feel. You want players to feel satisfied, like they achieved something, like they won. Two the universe itself was actually not expansive it was monotonous. Once you saw a dozen or so star systems you had pretty much seen it all. This on their part was one of Hello Games, and in particular Sean Murray's biggest mistakes.\n6. No real sense of meaningful achievement. The game never offered any real challenge or obstacle to overcome which made it hard to appreciate anything the game did offer. A sense of achievement is important for pretty much every game.", "upvoted": false, "time_of_review_unix": 1487308578, "upvotes_window": 43, "total_window": 127, "percent_window": 0.33858267716535434, "neu_sent": 0.789, "neg_sent": 0.081, "pos_sent": 0.13, "comp_sent": 0.9965, "neu_window": 0.6808671875000003, "neg_window": 0.19288281249999997, "pos_window": 0.11844531249999998, "comp_window": 0.04022812499999998, "percent_window_roc": 0.3381904069767442, "neu_window_roc": 0.9002947617904715, "neg_window_roc": 0.8329326923076923, "pos_window_roc": 0.46484375, "comp_window_roc": 0.10886915467625899, "1day_forecast": -0.00781344639612358, "1day_delta": -0.01856017997750281, "pos_predict": 0.021398558530618266, "neg_predict": 3.812232004872113e-05}, {"time_of_review": "2017-02-18T00:06:21", "review": "Well to be completely honest, I really wanted to try this game.

To landing in a space port, trading with an alien there, to finding my next planet and its stunning in different ways, its been awesome so far.\n\nLike the fact the hand holding is miminal, its up to you to find what you need to do what you want to do. I think there's even more hiding away in this game and finding it all and seeing what there is going to be a great experience.\n\nIt is a weird game no doubt. No other game compares though and the great thing is its really different.\n\nEdit: After 11hrs I stopped playing this pointless game and moved onto games like cities skylines, osiris:new dawn. It was nice and shiney to begin with then i released all planets look the same with the same setup, buildings and stuff to mine. Bored of endless mining, the annoying support suit messages, endless inventory management and didnt even want to jump to other systems. Some of the planets are lovely though and nice to explore but theres nothing to do or interact with a part from the same sat alien.

I would suggest you watch gameplay vids or check out a bunch of streamers first to be sure you will enjoy this type of game. Its not going to be for everyone.\n\nWhen the game came out and I enjoyed it for a while... then I began to see there was litteraly no challange to anything.  After the foundation update I tried survival mode and I must say, the challanges it introduces helped me really start enjoying this game again! It still lacks 'depth' but I'm okay with that. At least I knew what to expect when I came back ^_~\n\n+  A planet to claim and call home, upgradeable base I can teleport to and from as I like!\n+  Survival limits resources, life support drains fast, harsher conditions. Its a struggle.\n+  Slower pace with that sandboxie player-set-goals feel. No quests. Just free roam.\n+  More and deadlier enemies\n+  Cash sinks to spend those units!\n+  Hiring crew for my base\n+  Summonable giant freighter I can customize inside\n+  Some crazy neat planets!\n+  Some crazy neat animals!\n+  Entirely offline, slow, grindy, without goals, and repetitive.\n\nI am really looking forward to future updates and improvements.\n\n- Yes, its entirely offline, slow, grindy, without goals, and repetitive.\n- Yes, it has that \"indie\" feel.\n- Yes, Sean was an ass and lied to the public. Constantly. \n- Yes, cool stuff I wanted never made it to the game.\n- Yes, because of the RNG bellcurve you'll see similar looking planets and animals again.\n\n\nWith the foundation update, survival mode, on a new game I find I am enjoying this. Quite happy with the direction of development.  I give this a good 4/5\n\n\nAFTERTHOUGHT - A friend gifted this to me. I don't buy games this expensive. Well, not without a good sale. I do wish Hello Games offered a demo. I think that would have saved the company a lot of poop.

It's a really good and fun exploration game so far, I spent most of my game catalogueing an alien language. Roleplay and a achievement hunting are what drives this game so far.\n\nCons:\n\nResource hunting doesn't start off boring, but after you've spent a few hours playing it does get painful. As far as I've gotten, you can't get a ship-mounted mining beam so you always have to get out of your craft to mine. \n\nYou can't hover over the earth, as it auto-pilots if you get to close to the ground. \n\nYou can find ships that have crashed, with a distress beacon that implies that they've been shot down; if you shoot down a ship you will not find any wreckage, so you can't hijack ships.\n\nYou can enter camps and research sites to speak with aliens or observe weird, eerie spores, but you can't draw a weapon while indoors. This is problematic as some sites have plantlife that will attack you from inside the building, but you can't shoot them back. \n\nAlmost every planet supports life and there are no signs of water.\n\nFor some reason, the robots that attack you when you are on a planet also act as the universe's police force. If they detect you on land, you are attacked, but they won't attack you in the air or in space unless you shoot someone else.\n\nPros: \n\nThe animals are all very interesting, and you find a lot of unique ones. Occasionally you'll find a species you swear you've seen before, but in general they're pretty diverse.\n\nLanguages are very fun to learn. You can explore ruins or do favors for alien merchants to learn new words, and eventually understand full sentences.\n\nIt's both fun and easy to manipulate the economy and become rich as long as you put in a couple hours of work. For example, if you find ancient alien artifacts, the civilization that the artifacts belong to will pay a lot to get them.\n\nSummary:\n\nWould be more playable with a ship-mounted mining beam. Planets need to have liquid water.\n\nEDIT: I found liquid water underground inside of a cave system, but it didn't seem to have any effect on the environment.

The amount of absolutely ignorant and immature negative reviews is amazing to me. This game deserves better. \n\nOne thing you'll notice about all the negative reviewers is that they either have less than 10 hours of game time or over 100 hours. If you have less than 10 hours in this game, there is no way you have even come close to experiencing everything this game has to offer. On the other hand, if you got 100 hours or more of fun out of the game before getting bored and then wrote a negative review, you have mental issues. There are literally reviews on here where people say they enjoyed it for 150+ hours, but then they got bored, so they gave it a negative score.   \n\nI didn't follow this game's development, so I never really knew about the so-called hype for it. I also didn't purchase it until after the foundation update, so I can't speak as to what it was, wasn't or was suppose to be. This review is for what the game is now because that's all that really matters, isn't it?\n\nSo, is the game worth $60? Personally, I'd say no, but that's just because I can't remember the last time I payed $60 for any game. I don't really feel any game is worth that and this game is no different. I got it on sell for $35 and that's the most I've payed for a game in a long time. It's been worth every penny. If $60 is nothing to you, then it may well be worth it for this game. \n\nLet's get one thing out of the way first. The older trailers that are on this site are misleading and that stinks. There are game play features shown that are not in the game at all. Again, this stinks and shame on them for still having trailers with alpha footage on this site. Watch the newest trailers to see what the game actually looks like.\n\nThings that are in the older trailers that are not in the game:\n\n[*]The UI is completely different.\n[*]You don't get credit for discovering caves and oceans.\n[*]Creature AI is not as good as it looks in the trailers.\n[*]You cannot fly in formation with other ships.\n[*]There is no ship to ship combat on planets.\n[*]Traveling from one planet to another takes much longer.\n\nSo, having said that, if those things alone are enough for you to not give them your money, then so be it. It's understandable. People don't like being lied to.\n\nNow, here's what the game is actually like as of right now. \n\nAt it's core, this is an exploration game. It's what it was always suppose to be and most likely what it always will be. There is combat, but it's not the focus, so if you are the type of person that just wants to kill, kill, kill everything you see, then this is not the game for you. There are goals in the game, but there is no real end goal. You can't \"beat\" the game and it doesn't hold your hand and constantly point you in one direction. You can do whatever you want in any order you want to do it in.\n\nIt is also a grind-type game. There is no story. There is no ending. It's basically a game where you start off crashed on a random planet with a broken ship and a crappy multitool and from there you simply try to make a life for yourself in an infinite universe. If you like games where you are constantly trying to find better loot just for the sake of finding better loot, then you might like this game because that's what you do. You are constantly looking for better ships, a better multitool, a better freighter, and a nicer planet to build your base on, and since everything is randomly generated and especially now that ships and multitools have additional random stats, there is never a \"best\" weapon or \"best\" ship to find. There's always a chance you'll find something better than what you have.\n\nThere is no multiplayer in this game. As far as I can see, traditional multiplayer was never once promised to be in this game, so I'm not sure why so many people are still upset about it. Regardless, if you have to have multiplayer to enjoy a game, then this game isn't for you. \n\nAs of right now, here are just some of the things that ARE in the game:\n\n[*]Explore an infinite universe of procedurally generated planets. \n[*]Discover and rename planets and systems.\n[*]Discover and rename animals and plants.\n[*]Discover and rename ships and multitools.\n[*]Fully customize weapon types and other upgrades on ships, multitools, and exocrafts to suit your play style.\n[*]Mine for dozens of different types of resources to sell or craft with.\n[*]Extensive crafting system.\n[*]Claim any unclaimed planet as your own and build any type of base you want. Fully customizable.\n[*]You can move your base to a new planet anytime you want.\n[*]Build a farm with many different types of plants on your base that can be harvested for resources and loot.\n[*]Three different types of exocrafts that can be built and summoned on any planet.\n[*]Technically being a \"buy low/sell high\" trader is possible, but it's really not all that fun.\n[*]Buy massive freighters that can be summoned to any system and you can build a base on them.\n[*]Own multiple ships and store them on your freighter.\n[*]Share your base online and others can visit.\n[*]Fight off pirates who attack you in space.\n[*]Defend freighters under attack for a reward or join the pirates in attacking the freighter.\n[*]Random bounties for killing specific pirates sometimes appear.\n[*]Fight multiple types of sentinels both on planets and in space.\n[*]Four game modes to choose from, each with separate save files: Normal, Creative, Survival, and Permadeath.\n[*]There is game lore to learn if you bother to actually read certain things you discover.\n[*]Take awesome screenshots in photo mode. It's very similar to the photo mode in Shadow of Mordor where you can pause the game at any time, move camera around, adjust the lighting, etc.\n\nPerformance:\n \nThe game is beautiful if you can turn up the settings to max levels. Fair warning though, you need a pretty decent rig to do so. The game is not optimized all that great but seems to be getting better. I've got an i5 3.4 Ghz, 8 gigs of RAM, and a GTX 1050 and get 60 fps in space, but still dip under 30 sometimes on extremely lush planets. Overall, I'd say I average about 40 fps on most planets though and up to 60 on barren worlds. There are occasional bugs and crashes, but for me they are pretty rare.\n\nFinal thoughts:\n\nThere are other things to find and do that I did not list above because I don't want to completely ruin any surprises, but I wanted to list as many of the core features as I could think of off the top of my head. \n\nThis is not a race to the end type of game. It's a slow burn. EVERYTHING in the game takes a pretty long time to accomplish. This is a game that is meant to have endless game play, so don't expect to play it for 50 hours and have maxed out ships, weapons and freighters. In fact, don't be in a rush to get anything, just explore, set your own goals and don't worry if you still don't have a 48 slot ship after 100 hours. Best way to play this game is to not be in a rush to do anything.\n\nThe devs may have screwed up the launch of this game. Personally, I think Sony is to blame much more than they are, but that's a whole other story. The fact is that they are still cranking out huge content updates every few months for this game and it just keeps getting better. They could have taken the money and ran, but they didn't and you have to give them at least a little credit for that.\n\nAs I said before, the core game play in No Man's Sky is exploration and if that's something you like, then there is no game out there that does it any better. If you want tons of combat, this is not the game for you. If you want multiplayer, this is not the game for you. If you want a beautiful, endless universe to explore while constantly looking for the perfect ship, the perfect weapon, and the perfect planet to build the base of your dreams, then you will love this game.", "upvoted": true, "time_of_review_unix": 1489450054, "upvotes_window": 655, "total_window": 1179, "percent_window": 0.5555555555555556, "neu_sent": 0.75, "neg_sent": 0.1, "pos_sent": 0.15, "comp_sent": 0.9978, "neu_window": 0.7045203389830503, "neg_window": 0.12516949152542364, "pos_window": 0.1660559322033899, "comp_window": 0.3160626271186443, "percent_window_roc": 0.5547497043752464, "neu_window_roc": 0.9368459484142078, "neg_window_roc": 0.666883963494133, "pos_window_roc": 0.5724576271186441, "comp_window_roc": 0.48123856846726004, "1day_forecast": 0.012234091116589019, "1day_delta": 0.009851716433069257, "pos_predict": 0.14287881372026615, "neg_predict": 0.020748353188821345}, {"time_of_review": "2017-03-15T00:11:30", "review": "This game origanally was a disaster.

Rejected it initially as it fell short for my minimum gaming reqs ie co-op/multiplayer. Having now taken the plunge I am pleasantly surprised. Definitely more indie that the super duper polished titles we see these days but the gameplay and scope and potential keep me interested. Seemless transfer between spaceflight and planetary landing are exciting and fill gaps I was expecting to see in Elite. The space travel graphics are kinda drawn from a while back when graphics cards were a luxury but I enjoy this. On planet the music and attentive drones keep things real and inspire exploration. I have played both Grav and Osiris and there are elements of each game which are complemented well. Overall I was expected not a lot when I got this on a steam deal but keep coming back most days for more. Animated lifelife aliens would be great rather than circa 1990's static pics but it captures the nostalgic feel to the game and works well. Be great to see some kind of co-op feature included as our clan would all guy this if added. So to summerise NMS has exceeded my expectations and look forward to seeing how things develop.

Initially it could do a better job of training you on the basics, but i think it is trying to stay out of your face and let you figure out you own way.

I personally think Sean should have said something (f%$in anything!!?) after the PR sh%$ storm they received. That said, I think the hate against this game got a bit rediculous, and imagine at least 50% of negative reviews are mindless drones copying 'lies lies lies!!' cry babies. In any case, I agree that at release it's not worth 60 bucks, hence buying it on sale, and it still has some ground to cover in becoming the game I think most people want it to be.\n\n[h1] My Experience [/h1]\n\nI am absolutely loving this game! The visuals are beautiful (see my screenshots! [url=http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198296647968/screenshots/?appid=275850&sort=newestfirst&browsefilter=myfiles&view=imagewall] HERE [/url]). The progression in character abilities and enhancements is really well executed. Contrary to popular opinion, I am finding tonnes of things to do in this game. E.g. just look at steam achievements, there's a 'todo list', if you're not into a complete sandbox (i.e. objectiveless) experience. While not perfect, the random generation algorithims seem to work quite well for me, and I am constantly met with new and interesting environements and situations to explore and experience.\n\nIn short, I think the game as it stands is well worth the sale price I paid, and certainly has the potential to be worth those 60 bucks.\n\n[h1] Game Modes (mainly survival) [/h1]\n\nI am not a particularly casual gamer, so at present I have stuck to survival and permadeath. I realise this is something that the original release didn't include, and so can forgive negative reviews based on the limited casual play; personally I like a challenge. I died twice on permadeath, then decided to just stick with my survival game until I reached the center of the galaxy (getting achievement), then there's some replayability on permadeath (different achievement), when I'm more of a vet explorer.\n\nAt the very beginning the game can be very difficult, but far from unfair as I've seen some people complaining about. As long as you plan things, make use of resources and learn from your mistakes, you should be able to pull through. E.g. if you head out into a blizzard from a cave and get past 50% frost protection without turning back, you are taking a risk, and cannot complain when you end up freezing to death being whipped by wild plants and animals.\n\nI died a few times on both survival and permadeath, before getting my bearings with the game's mechanics and vital methods required to survive. Since then, it has only gone uphill for me. I love getting a new ship, a new power tool, new game changing abilities like vehicles (exocraft) and extra inventory storage (huge driver to improve). Initially it's a bit of a grind, especially with iron, but I see that as a necessary evil in order to really appreciate the progression and upgrades towards faster grinding, including grenades that instantly mine out an area of resources for you.\n\n[h1] Random Generation (v1.2) [/h1]\n\nSo one of the biggest challenges this game faces is how to randomly generate terrain, items and biological organisms in a variety of ecosystems / environments, and make it look 'good'. I think we should acknowledge that this is a very non-trivial task. So I can excuse the odd c%$k up, and even enjoy them for the hilarious frankensteinien messes they are, big fan of [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5jWtz3rzco] this vid [/url]! (cracks me up every time)\n\nIn my experience, the terrain generation is working wonderfully right now. Caves, valleys and mountain ranges feel natural in most places. I actually got lost exploring a cave system so extensive my life support ran out before I could get back out (lesson learned, unplanned caving ~ risky). The planetary flora is wonderfully varied in color and style; recently found a tree that appeared to be covered in anuses, named it 'Anusesgalore'! The fauna can be hit and miss, though on average feels quite good and decently varied in the stock parts used in random generation.\n\nThough whatever I've said here, I advise you to go look at my screenshots (maybe small spoilers, but if you're concerned, just avoid reading any text)! They say it all (I'm an sc whore, especially in a game that includes a specialized feature to take photographs!). You may formulate your own opinion from these (and I imagine many others people have taken).\n\n[h1] Pros and Cons [/h1]\n\nSo I'm now getting lil bored writing this, and I think you get my opinion of the game as it stands. I'll list some pros and cons from my perspective, then wrap up.\n\n[b] Pros [/b]\n\n[list]\n    [*] BEAUtiful environments and creatures (with the odd failed genetic experiment).\n    [*] Compelling races, characters and ongoing stories (e.g. quest lines with base characters).\n    [*] Varied land and space combat, with multiple weapon styles and enemies.\n    [*] Well designed progessional systems, keeping you hooked for that next upgrade.\n[/list]\n\n[b] Cons [/b]\n\n[list]\n    [*] PR fell into an abyss from day one.\n    [*] Damaged reputation from what I would agree was a far less respectable version 1.0 (1.2 ~ much better).\n    [*] Someone let Sean out of the programming room and into some interviews where his over excited imagination cacked everything up for them.\n    [*] Though I think the game as it stands is wonderful to play, still feels a bit like something that's in development and pushed out way too early. The 60$ price tag was bs, and a terrible shame they didn't decide to cut it back a bit.\n[/list]\n\n[h1] Summary / Closing Remarks [/h1]\n\nThere's a lot more I could say about my experience with this game, though as mentioned I'm getting bored of typing this and it's that in general I reccomend getting it on sale, or even retail price if you think it sounds like something you'll really enjoy (probably is!).\n\nI will say that one cool feature appears to be how you can name and upload things you 'discover', and get paid based on the 'importance' of the discovery. E.g. life forms typically make you more money than rocks :P. Here is where any 'multiplayer' currently lies, as you are able to see other people's naming of discoveries, and vice versa, and it's like you're part of a community working to map out and explore this randomly generated universe. Again, non-trivial problem, and I admire and am impressed at the current state of it.\n\nAlso, for opposing view at release, please see [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTTPlqK8AnY] angry joe's take [/url] on this (probably my favorite game reviewer). I will say that many of the things he complains about have been addressed in the recent updates, e.g. when a milestone is unlocked, you have the option to quickly skip it if you wish.\n\nFinally, my personal advice to anyone reading this and seriously tempted to buy this game: Ignore the negative reviewers, most of whom are jumping on a band wagon of trolls and haters; Look at [url=http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198296647968/screenshots/?appid=275850&sort=newestfirst&browsefilter=myfiles&view=imagewall] my screenshots [/url] as primary source material on what things look like in the game right now, and make your own decision. Personally it took me a few days to weigh it up, but in the end I caved and I'm so glad I did!", "upvoted": true, "time_of_review_unix": 1492560865, "upvotes_window": 60, "total_window": 116, "percent_window": 0.5172413793103449, "neu_sent": 0.778, "neg_sent": 0.103, "pos_sent": 0.119, "comp_sent": 0.9706, "neu_window": 0.706700854700855, "neg_window": 0.14182051282051283, "pos_window": 0.14294017094017095, "comp_window": 0.24684188034188043, "percent_window_roc": 0.550467103955476, "neu_window_roc": 0.9505795616440043, "neg_window_roc": 0.5207100591715976, "pos_window_roc": 0.5384615384615385, "comp_window_roc": 0.55085931254996, "1day_forecast": 0.01784633998790075, "1day_delta": -0.011213905242500655, "pos_predict": 0.14535303810559258, "neg_predict": 0.0068928914603749334}, {"time_of_review": "2017-04-20T05:00:08", "review": "After reviewing my hate comments, which i will leave here, i realized that people make mistakes.

As for Planetary exploration, every 10-15 seconds, the game will do a FPS fluxuation and my frames will hop all over the place, creating the unbearable stutter.

All of the planets look the same beyond being water or toxic or terran. Despite that one difference, all the rest is the same. You have to collect words, but not just important words, all the words in an entire language. There seems to be no point in doing so either and it just all takes so long and is so monotonous. I really wish there were something to do, the framework is great, but the game is more boring than watching reality tv. Please update with some actual content! I can't believe they think this is a releasable game. I have early access games with more content and replayability than this.\n\nOne other thing that angered me a bit is that I got the preorder ship, but within 4 hours of play I found one that was crashed but much better. After a quick repair (the same repair as for my preorder ship), I had just rendered a large portion of my purchase price meaningless. Everyone who didn't act like a fool and preorder will probably pay much less for this game as I can see the price falling drastically within a very short time. You know, I wasn't even angry that the newly found ship was better, but I was disappointed that the pre-order ship that is supposed to be better than the starter ship was actually really lame. A crashed ship in the first 4 hours of play was considerably better. It had 17 slots, and a load of weapons and defense upgrades. Considering how little difference there is in all the ships over all, the pre-order ship really should have been a lot better. There's very little advantage to it and I was sad that I had to throw it away so quickly.\n\nOh BTW, if you want a game that this game was supposed to be, Empyrion and StarMade are BOTH leaps and bounds beyond this game and are FAR cheaper.\n\nUpdate:\nThey've added a couple of updates, and the game still isn't what I was told I was buying when I preordered it (like a fool). Never pre-order. In the same space of time that NMS has added 2 big updates, Empyrion and StarMade have done more... for less. Rebel Galaxy is another good game if you like flying around.

The game is actualy starting to make progress! Base building, land vehicles, and Photo Mode are all great additions. Sadly though, even with adding a few more things to do, Its still the same old game. \nIts fun for a few hours, but then it gets repetative doing the same stuff over and over and over, just to do the most basic things. \nNow i dont mind a little bit of a grind, this is a exploration/survival game after all, so grinding is expected. But this games grind seems to be a bit excessive even for what it is\n\nThen there is the content. Im happy they have added a bunch of stuff to the game. But, its still pretty far from where it should have been at launch. It still feels like the game should have multiplayer, and it still feels like there should be much more you are able to do. \nIt is incomplete.\nWhy this hasnt been clasified as Early Acess? Idk...\n\nDo I expect it to ever be finished? Probably not. But hopefuly in a year or so it will look more like the game we all expected to have. \n\n\nFor now, ill change my review back to a thumbs up, just for the sake of helping the game possibly rise from the ashes someday. \nHowever, I DO NOT recomend paying full price in its curent state. Id say if it goes on sale for under $30, it would be worth it.\n\n\n- LAUNCH REVIEW -\n So after playing about 20 hours, I cant reccomend this game anymore. It was good at first, but after exploring the same lifeless, boring, planets over and over, the game gets really stale. There isnt really anything to work for, other than getting to teh center of the Galaxy, and there really isnt much insentive to do that. \nHours and hours of grindng trying to get hyperdive upgrades and almost always coming out with nothing gets old. \nThey game may have infinite possibilies, but those infinite possibilites are all VERY similar :\\\n\nOn top of all that it feels like a game that you should be able to play with friends. But you cant. Being alone in such an infinite spaceseems a bit pontless, eh? \n\nI can see potential in this game IF they continue to add to it, but so far its looking liek they wont. Right now id say its worth $20.

You are randomly placed in the universe of 18 quintillion planets and tasked with the mission of exploring planets that you can call your own - discovering creatures and spectacular views along the way. The procedural generation means that you can go past dozens of planets without seeing one that resembles another.\n\nUnfortunately the game is not quite as polished as I (and many others) expected. Upon launch it had several bugs which made gameplay pretty tedious, and indicated the overall rushjob that the game cleary was.

But here it is:\n\nI believe it was the first week of launch that I decided to purchase this game. I was super excited, like most of the gaming world. I made it through the first few weeks of the absolute hate storm that surrounded the launch. People quickly realized through videos and pictures, they were all seeing the same things. During the press and up to release, most the game that we play today, is no where even close to the game that was promised. But I still kept blinders on and decided to keep treking through my space journey. Even after all of the hate, which I completely understood, I still enjoyed the game. And it was for one reason: Curiosity. The idea of having an entire universe in the palm of my hands for exploring was one thing. But what drew me into this game so much was the idea that I could be the first to find something new or unique before any other player. And I adored that. The 'what's on the other side of this mountain' honeymoon phase faded around 15 hours in. Which is much longer than most. Once I realized I had an entire universe to explore, but have already seen it all reskinned in 5 hours, completely killed this game for me. \n\nEven though there has been a few updates that included base building and land vehicles, I still just can't convince myself to launch up the game and play longer than ten minutes. The updates brought me back to check out the game again. I launched it and went into the base building game type. I walked around for maybe 5 minutes not having a clue how to build anything. But more importantly not caring to learn at all. A major update will bring life into this game. And I mean MAJOR. At this point, I'm fine we will never get the game that we saw at E3. I'm accepted it. Sadly. But the only thing that will make me enjoy this game even in the slightest, is much better universe generating. From the planets all the way down to the plants. That will bring back that sense of curiosity and excitement again. But until that day, this game will remain sitting in Steam game library.

The immensity of thier under-delivery makes Spore look like an incredible success by comparison. I sunk about 40 hours of gameplay into this, and after about 16 the patterns in the game are so blatantly recognizabgle, that any suspended disbelief comes crashing down on your head, and shatters the immersive quality.\n\nThe only joy I got out of the game was naming and categorizing the various species of the more interesting worlds (which were incredibly scarce and impossible to mark for return), and learning alien languages via an extremely grindy collection system. These are the most rewarding activities in a sea of pointlessness. This game is a sandbox, so directionlessness is to be expected, but in other sandbox games, there are unique and interesting story threads and hooks to draw you to the good bits, and you are rewarded for exploring them farther. No Man's Sky has no such story, only vague and shallow references to historic events that have no impact on the game play, or the static and stiff \"characters\" (if you can even call them that, as the only things you interact with in the game are dumb animals and vendor merchants).\n\nTo be fair, the engine is powerful, and the developers have broken a lot of ground with the way procedural generation can be used in games, and a lot of respect and credit is due there. The game is also beautiful. The bubbly and saturated aesthetic makes exploring very fun, and the style is detailed enough that you'll catch yourself admiring a lot of the flora and fauna. I took a lot of pretty screenshots cresting hills and looking out over crazy alien vistas, I even set my desktop backround as one for a while. It was a nice stress reliver after work to just fly around and name animals and take pictures.\n\nMechanically on the other hand, the game is lacking in some simple and time-tested necessary UI features. It doesn't even have a system of mapping or tracking the worlds you have visited, making it frusturating to find your way back to resource deposits or just cool sites. The game is very inventory dependent, and the tools it gives you for managing those inventories are counterintuitive and limiting, making you constantly feel like you're being punished for collection things (which i must stress is all you can really do in the game.) The gameplay is incredibly repetitive, and grindy, as you blast rocks to get resources to build things... that make you better at blasting rocks to build more things... that also blast rocks. The combat is easy to master and the enemies lack variety and challenge, not to mention they are basically a lore-less cop-out of designing a compelling antagonist. It feels entirely like an after thought.\n\nAll in all, the amount of time you have to sink into this game is immense, and the rewards are paultry and empty feeling (aside from building a ship, that was dope.) The story is weaker than hotel coffee, and the gameplay is akin to making cornmeal. A rating of 4 out of 10 would be generous, and its only because I respect the studio and what they have done here, not because I think the game experience deserves it.", "upvoted": false, "time_of_review_unix": 1496627824, "upvotes_window": 39, "total_window": 133, "percent_window": 0.2932330827067669, "neu_sent": 0.746, "neg_sent": 0.096, "pos_sent": 0.158, "comp_sent": 0.9953, "neu_window": 0.6785671641791048, "neg_window": 0.17414925373134324, "pos_window": 0.13982835820895526, "comp_window": 0.10242089552238809, "percent_window_roc": 0.2600138840680319, "neu_window_roc": 0.8799826619930469, "neg_window_roc": 0.9850746268656717, "pos_window_roc": 0.4440298507462687, "comp_window_roc": 0.10399441640717277, "1day_forecast": 0.005274379979800237, "1day_delta": -0.005979515718429973, "pos_predict": 0.22769379729071207, "neg_predict": 0.0004430034899865816}, {"time_of_review": "2017-06-06T02:19:00", "review": "Just Horrible", "upvoted": false, "time_of_review_unix": 1496715540, "upvotes_window": 40, "total_window": 133, "percent_window": 0.3007518796992481, "neu_sent": 0.222, "neg_sent": 0.778, "pos_sent": 0.0, "comp_sent": -0.5423, "neu_window": 0.6786940298507466, "neg_window": 0.1714701492537313, "pos_window": 0.14238059701492536, "comp_window": 0.12185000000000006, "percent_window_roc": 0.2600138840680319, "neu_window_roc": 0.8799826619930469, "neg_window_roc": 0.9850746268656717, "pos_window_roc": 0.4440298507462687, "comp_window_roc": 0.10399441640717277, "1day_forecast": -0.004455583402951824, "1day_delta": 0.002244417012680966, "pos_predict": 0.2690706154988165, "neg_predict": 0.0007764085249141642}, {"time_of_review": "2017-06-07T06:21:11", "review": "I don't even need to write a review anymore", "upvoted": false, "time_of_review_unix": 1496816471, "upvotes_window": 40, "total_window": 132, "percent_window": 0.30303030303030304, "neu_sent": 1.0, "neg_sent": 0.0, "pos_sent": 0.0, "comp_sent": 0.0, "neu_window": 0.6972781954887219, "neg_window": 0.1500977443609022, "pos_window": 0.14511278195488725, "comp_window": 0.14709172932330833, "percent_window_roc": 0.261968875677566, "neu_window_roc": 0.8765240835197318, "neg_window_roc": 0.9543088490456911, "pos_window_roc": 0.4473684210526316, "comp_window_roc": 0.10477632931248985, "1day_forecast": 0.004662004662004671, "1day_delta": 0.0089126559714795, "pos_predict": 0.23228320130198424, "neg_predict": 0.0024224286744573584}, {"time_of_review": "2017-06-08T00:43:27", "review": "F this game, it sucks...

I have to say that I feel sucked in with everyone else, and had higher expectations for how good this game would be. This is not my reason for writing this review, as much as I feel that I should have payed less for a game with very little variation and progression. I have to say that the game ran really well on my PC from installation, and I am only running mid range/average specs, so I feel that alot of the people having trouble on higher end computers likely havent updated drivers or made some other simple oversight which has lead them to form such strong opinions of the game. \n\nI truly believe that this is the future of gaming, in form and function. Obviously there could be far more attention to detail, more sub plots, more mechanics to keep people engaged, more avenues to success. But thats not the point. This is an entire virtual Universe, a gargantuan construction of maths and imagination that is  infinite in its possibilities and scope. Just because the first attempt at synthesising a simulation of all existence didn't result in a smash success doesn't mean the project was a failure. It should show the world that there is a real hunger in the community for this style of game design, and if a larger and more competent team could take the reins on a grand vision like this something truly groundbreaking could result.

They hold them responsible for the promises they made and never delivered on. But lets take a step back fpr a moment.\n\nWhen I first bought this game, I had herd NOTHING about it execpt what I saw Markiplier and Jacksepticeye play on it. Yes, the $60 price tag was steep for me, but that was the price of nearly every big name game at the time, so I held it at the same level as the other games. \n\nWhen I first started playing, I was enthralled. I was loving the whole concept of the game. The multiple lange system that you had to learn each and every word for, the barter system, the space combat (albeit kind of lacking in enemy diversity),  and the ever changing planet terrain and weather.\n\nAfter about 35 hours (Which is longer than the ENTIRE GAMEPLAY of MOST games coming out on the market today), I started to feel a sense of repetitiveness. So I looked up reviews on the game, and thats when I got swept away in the torrent of negativity. I critasized every little flaw could find and beratted the game because it was not what it was supposed to be.\n\nBut now, I have taken a step back and I realized something. I bought a game. I payed this price for something that came from someones mind. An Idea that sprang up and was turned into digital data. I have attempted to make games before before, and let me tell you, the complicated algoritms to even make 10% of a game like this function correctly is a level that I will never understand. Its a game, and for all its negativity, its well made. I found very little glitches. Its a fully explorable, 100% Free Roam environment space exploration game. Which is actually pretty cool. Its fully 3D, and in VR, this would really be something special, and its GIGIANTIC. It took me 41 hours to explore 3 galaxies. and only FULLY explore 1 of those. And that alone, is worthy of my time. Sure, a lot of the Textures are a little blocky and flat, but no game is perfect. and maybe thats just the idea behind it. \n\nI can argue all day with people about this, but this is my review. I give this game a positive rating because its a Well Put Together idea. I have no play issues. Everything flows smoothly. The game holds my attention and for all its bad hype, its a GAME. I have seen people pay a LOT more for a LOT less. I have seen people pay $70 for games full of bugs and compleatly incomplete. So I say, play it with an open mind and be honest to yourself. Its a game. I dont care what the developer diod or said. what I care about is the GAME and thats what I am reviewing. Plus, at least the developers are taking the critasism to heart and trying to make the game better. The newest release added a lot of new things to the game, so I say check it out if you want to.

From the moment you take off you are hauling ass until you hit auto land making exploring a major pain in the ass.\n\nWhile flying you will see \"?\" appear wich indicate a point of interest to land at but they randomly just disappear and reappear in front of you.\n\nA lot of the time you may not want to land at a place because the fuel requirements for taking off are just dumb (side note: plutonium fuel is required for flying above ground but iron for fuel while in space wtf?) But anyway sometimes its ust not worth stopping at a place because it takes so much fuel to launch again and often times you cant even see the place you potentially would like to land at because you are going to fast, its obsucured by a hill and pointing the ship down is just not an option which leads me to next point.\n\nTrying to look down while flying is just the most infuriating shit I have ever done in any game. The ship resists this to the max and ultimately you just flip upside down like a broken toy flying in some kind of weird ass direction. Seriousl, there are real people who designed it this way and someone saw it and said YES! I mean wtf are these devs even thinking.\n\nEverything about flying hinders exploration which is the main point of this game is it not? I mean i don't need a realistic flight sim here. Just some very basic shit listed above. I can play elite or ksp for more complicated flying.\n\nWhen you land you get booted out of your ship wether you like it or not. If landing on a landing pad it kicks your ass off the pad itself onto the dirt smdh.\n\nThe ony difference in ships is the amount of inventory slots and the way the ship looks? Seriously wtf? I found a couple of crashed ships, got so excited about this. Oh cool that ship looks badass..way better than mine. I can fix this ship and just take it? hell yea. Well its got triple the amount of inventory slots but they are 90% all broken. No problem i can fix those. 100,000 units per slot? (units are money in the game) ummm ok...fix a few, now its 250,000 for some more slots.. seriously why? It wouldve been cheaper to just buy one in the starport. What a cool feature totally ruined. Why didnt they make it so you had to make repair compenents to fix, so you could grind out some resources and craft. Nope fuck it lets just make it cost money and be done with it. Lazy.\n\nBeyond flying my main complaints are just confirmation about what many other reviews have said about the repetitve nature of the game.\n\nExtreme lack of variety. Its like saying I have and endless amount of cups in my kitchen and they are all different but in reality they are all the same cup style with some diff colors and inside the exact same thing maybe a diff color but there is no reason to look beyond the first cup, you have seen all the rest.\n\nEvery game needs a hook, especially survival games. The only hook in the game is to grind for more inventory slots, so you can hold more stuff needed to sell so you can get more inventory slots and that is just about it. \n\nI'm pretty sure the devs copied the inside of a space station, ya know the single one they designed, and pasted it to every single space staion in the game. Its so boring please kill me now.\n\nI can't say enough about how many times you will run inside the exact same buildings answering the exact same questions when presented with a puzzle. All the stuff inside is the same. And this is 99% of everything everwhere.  \n\nI'm not one of the people who followed this game or the hype. I don't give a crap about the lies or whatever the devs did or didnt say. I just waited for this to go on sale. I'm not paying $60 for a game with overwhelemingly negative reviews warranted or not but these Hello Games people or whoever is in charge of that decision are stupid as hell apparently. I got this on steam summer sale. $24 i think. In my just everyday guy worthless opinion I think the game is worth about $15 so not too bad of a mistake.\n\nThings i liked:\n\nI will admit I didnt have any performance issues, crashes or bugs which is great.\n\nThe best thing about the game is using the scanner to identify plants and widlife then renaming them and uploading to server.\n\nThe creatures you encounter are so damn ugly and misshapen they are just a hiilarious addition to the game although laughing at them probably isnt what the devs had in mind, me and the kids had fun with that.\n\nReally trying to be fair here but I can't think of much else I liked besides the art and colors looking great.\n\nWell I could spend more time on this but why bother? Trolls and fanbois wil bitch at me in comments no matter what but hey for that one person like me who may read this and it just may help them make up their mind,", "upvoted": false, "time_of_review_unix": 1498695468, "upvotes_window": 154, "total_window": 337, "percent_window": 0.456973293768546, "neu_sent": 0.746, "neg_sent": 0.144, "pos_sent": 0.11, "comp_sent": -0.9948, "neu_window": 0.701292899408284, "neg_window": 0.1464615384615385, "pos_window": 0.14930769230769222, "comp_window": 0.21654082840236688, "percent_window_roc": 0.3529792211366451, "neu_window_roc": 0.9356028679016983, "neg_window_roc": 0.7660446062812927, "pos_window_roc": 0.48668639053254437, "comp_window_roc": 0.2937534587714444, "1day_forecast": 0.016416061973750895, "1day_delta": 0.018435087788479576, "pos_predict": 0.4266438578107969, "neg_predict": 0.00043091581458390297}, {"time_of_review": "2017-06-30T01:01:41", "review": "Just no.

It's more of a toy. Think Spore, but focused on exploration from a ground level, first person pov. In the same way that Spore, Sim City, and Sims titles fail to have an interesting end game or goal, so does this. It's a strange generative universe with odd things to stumble upon. Unlike Sims games, though, it's not even really built to \"entertain\". This is a very \"hard sci-fi\" kind of game. The interest here is in pondering the nature of this artificial universe and soaking in a very specific kind of tone that isn't present in sci-fi much these days. It has no grit, very little conflict, and what few \"characters\" exist aren't really interested in getting to know you or vice-versa. There is no \"adventure\" to be had here, nor is this supposed to be Space Minecraft.\nAnother way to think of this is as a super-massive, sci-fi version of Proteus. I recommend you approach this game in the same way. If you didn't enjoy Proteus, you have no reason to expect enjoying this. Expect little in the way of guidance on how to have fun or instructions telling you what's worth accomplishing. This is very much like *actually* exploring the endless cosmos. Sometimes there just isn't much of interest, and on occasion you see something neat and interesting.

No Man's Sky is not a full game at the point of release for console and PC; with varying degrees of performance such as stutters and crashes on different platforms, it detracts immersion from the experience. This game is not worth the $60 I bought it for and I regret purchasing it. \n\nThe process of gathering resources to upgrade new weapons and ships is very monotonous. I'm a grind kind of person myself, don't get me wrong, but it is vital to upgrade to unlock more inventory slots. With different elements, upgrades, refills, the whole process becomes a sorting nightmare. There's very little inventory space to do much with, sometimes picking slots over vital upgrades is common. Exploration will become mundane after seeing the same variation of animals, plants and rocks - you'll start to notice the patterns if scans are a regular part of your play style to get units. The AI is pretty bland. which further detracts from the whole experience. Animals don't go to drink water, interact, or do much, unless they are hostile. And even then, the stalker ones will just run circles around the player and the aggressive ones straight on attack.\n\nLet's be honest here, this game was probably developed more around console than PC. The ship controls are very unnatural in the way that the game practically does everything for you and it just plays better with a controller. I only make this claim not only for the above, but also since players in the cockpit of a ship can sway the head left and right. Can't do that on PC. Another example would be not being able to get close to a planet's surface, else the ship will redirect the player. Even hitting anything in space does nothing to the ship, it just bounces around until swaying off. And that's another thing: the game doesn't really have good physics in mind either. \n\nI had set a ship ontop of a plant and after destroying its platform the ship stayed in the air. It's also possible for the ship to get stuck in places such as rocks, minerals, caves - you name it. Without the bread and butter that is the ship, you can't go anywhere, therefore the only solution to unsticking it is roam the planet for a recall station. There, the ship is teleported back onto a platform at your location.\n\nThis game was definitely not purposed around being a shooter, that's for sure. Feels clunky. Found a few bugs with some of the upgrades myself that allowed me to basically one-shot most things from LONG RANGE.\n\nLuckily, I haven't had time to recommend No Man's Sky, and I'll refrain from doing so. Although I may come back at a later date, I'll still have the sour taste this release left me. Again, at face value, this game is incomplete.

It's by turns exhilarating in its vastness, yet gorgeously relaxing to just bum around in.  The worlds I've seen have been incredibly beautiful; from lush forests and tundra, to the bleakest, barren, poisonous rocks, they've all been an absolute pleasure to explore.  The spaces between things don't make the game boring to me, they make it immersive, and render each new discovery something special.  As a fan of games like Dear Esther and Abzu, this is a simple delight, yet one so grand in scale, and with far more gameplay possibilities than those games, now with base building as well as resource gathering, crafting, trading etc. that I could lose myself in it for a long, long time to come.\n\nThis is the first time I've written a Steam review, and I felt compelled to do it because of how much scorn has been poured on this game, and how much I love it.

I'd be sad to see their future plans not come to fruition because of a rough launch and a reactionary public.\n\nRealistically, I guess I couldn't recommend this game to just anyone, but to people like me, I can't recommend it strongly enough.", "upvoted": true, "time_of_review_unix": 1501373503, "upvotes_window": 70, "total_window": 162, "percent_window": 0.43209876543209874, "neu_sent": 0.769, "neg_sent": 0.08, "pos_sent": 0.152, "comp_sent": 0.9608, "neu_window": 0.7308036809815952, "neg_window": 0.1254907975460123, "pos_window": 0.13762576687116562, "comp_window": 0.2435055214723926, "percent_window_roc": 0.46637180767584535, "neu_window_roc": 0.9536008434202399, "neg_window_roc": 0.6229353468617272, "pos_window_roc": 0.5153374233128835, "comp_window_roc": 0.4167751688219976, "1day_forecast": -0.006172839506172811, "1day_delta": 0.0, "pos_predict": 0.06832653228455757, "neg_predict": 0.058411977975164696}, {"time_of_review": "2017-07-31T04:23:46", "review": "This game was the 911 of games.

I went through a portal to a strange alien world with six sided leafs on the trees and weird yellow energy flowing through them, it was like something out of star trek and yet i was the first to see it ever, it was my own journey, mine, no-one elses. for the first time a game actually offers you true exploration, no linear path, no map to explore that a million people have seen before you, but new territory that YOU get to be the first to see and explore, not even the developers have seen what you will, and thats amazing, ive always wanted a game I could have a true adventure in, and that game is No Man's Sky.\n\n\ntheres also base building, you can make yourself a home, have staff in it that operate different terminals, you can farm with the help of a handy farmer, mines a gek, thats a species of alien in no mans sky, my favorites. to grow stuff, you can research tech with scientists. decorate  it with cool furniture to really make it feel like a detailed building. \"but ill only be remaining on planets for a short while, whats the point of a base when ill just lose it because im galaxies away and cant find the way back\" I hear you probably (not) thinking, well have no fear on that front because in every space station theres a teleporter that can instantly teleport you into your base no matter how far away you are (and it allows you to teleport back to the space station you were just at), so you can never lose it, go nuts and build your base as eleborate or as simple as you want.\n\n\n\nNo Man's Sky is the only game I know that gives you a journey that is truly yours to have, a unique experience that nobody else in the world will ever have. be warned though, this game will be boring if your looking for lots of combat or story. buy this game if you love exploring and adventure, it scratches that itch every time.", "upvoted": true, "time_of_review_unix": 1503014732, "upvotes_window": 2304, "total_window": 2726, "percent_window": 0.8451944240645635, "neu_sent":

It was slow, it was repetitive, and it lacked depth.  There was very little to actually DO- I didn't much care for all the drama around the hype; it was disappointing yes, but my main issues were the lack of things to do.\n\nNow that there've been some updates, the game is much, much better! It's still slow, and it's still repeptitive. But if you enjoy a solo experience where you do the grind and get the rewards, it's a good game. It still has some major flaws in my opinion, mostly lost opportunities- all the bases, and space stations look the same with only exceedingly minor differences. There's still only like, 3 people in a space station, and the conversations and interactions are just as shallow as before. The pilots of the ships that dock at trade ports and space stations never get out of their ships- overall, the universe is a lonely feeling place, with just the barest of hints at the life and cultures around you. The overhyped 'random creatures' you find on planets are all still very, very samey, as is all the planets plant life. Supposedly that's been updated as well, but I haven't really traveled very far in the 40 hours I've played since the latest update, and haven't seen anything I hadn't seen the first time around. That's not to say you don't find neat things, and I have for sure, but MOST of the fauna I've encountered have all looked much the same across the planets I've visited.\n\nAll around though, it's a better experience. There are minor quests you can do to earn some money and items. There's a new and improved main quest chain to work on, probably the best addition I've noticed, which leads you through building a base, and getting your land rover thingy, as well as upgrades and craftables. There's much more of a goal in mind than 'fly around between planets'. Flying the ships feels good, and every ship feels different in it's maneuverability; space combat feels better as well, provided you've outfitted your ship with weapons and upgrades and own one with decent manueverability. You can also buy the enormous Freighters that warp in near space stations, and keep multiple ships on them, though they're exceedingly expensive and it's a late game prospect. The graphics are great, though there are some stylistic choices that some people don't like. I think they're fine.  I'm personally not a huge fan of the menus and UI, but it does the job. Some things are still frustratingly random, like finding upgrades you want, or new multitools, or decent ships.\n\nIt's nice that the developers have continued to work on the game- there's still a LOT they could do, and I hope they continue, but they've made a good effort so far and persisted despite the hate train around their game, which is commendable. They've done enough now that I could happily recommend this game to the right person.\n\nSo yeah, I'd recommend this game for sure-IF you do proper research and know what you're getting. Don't go into it expecting it to be something that it isn't and get upset about it. Watch some videos and read the RECENT in depth reviews. Know that it's a very time consuming game, that's focused around exploration, and it's slow to play. It rewards time and effort, and you need to know if those rewards are going to be enough payoff for you.

But other than minor things it has all around got better. More space battles, freighters to purchase, 6 ships can be owned at one time, base building, improved inventory management, land vehicles, weather and atmosphere is a huge factor now rather than an annoyance that every few mins you just recharge hazard protection (caught in a storm? that'll wipe out your protection in under 60 seconds without cover).\n\nA very enjoyable, relaxing game.

I'm still not 100% what this is!?!\nIs it to explore the aliens, in the tedious \"story\" arc? Hmmm, I lost interest in that from the get go!\n\nIs it to mine constantly, so you can buy bigger ships and then mine more, then buy the biggest ships, then mine more, and eventually die of old age?

Sure you can dog fight some NPC's that are painfully easy to kill, but what else? The only real benefit of getting better ships is to mine more! Hooray!\n\nMaybe base building is the aim?....no, it can't be! Because bases are FUGLY, simplistic and generally pointless too. even the occupants you can hire, just stand in the corner and do nothing! Even THEY are bored!!!!\n\nMaybe it's to travel to far off worlds and meet strange new civili...NOPE! It's not that either! not when the aliens are all mid-2000 low poly, low texture cartoon characters, who all live in the same few variations of bases and sit in the same places every time.\nOh and the strange new worlds!....The worlds are about as different from each other as Coke is from Pepsi!\nThe \"proceeduraly generated\" animals are also a fail. There are about 20 different variations of life across the entire galaxy apparently! THERE ARE MORE VARIATIONS IN INNER CITIES ON EARTH! I didn't need No Man's Sky. I needed a walk outside!\nA cow-horse with a long neck and purple spots and a cow-horse with a short neck and purple spots, does not make a totally new species, Hello Games!\n\nMaybe it's for the survival and resource management elements?....\n\n\"So, I need resource A, B and C to make tedious device X.... A and B are available in this system. Let's go!!\"\n....Ship out of take off fuel....\n\"Ok no problem, I'll just go gather some.....done, let's go!!!!\"\n....Flies to identical \"different\" planets. Spends 20 minutes mining and moving things around to make space...done....\n\"Now to go and get resource C from the next system, let's go!!!\"\n....No hyperspace fuel. Gather resource D, E and F....\n\"Urghhh, OH-KAY. D and E are available here....the F is available on planet...screw it, I'll buy it from the space station...let's go!!\"\n....Ship out of take off fuel....\n\"Noooo problemmm, I'll just go gather som......nah F*** this F****** BULLS****, I'm going to work, where I will actually be paid real money for driving myself to an early stress related death!\"\n\nI even tried the free mode, which just demonstrated to me how pointless this game is. Mining and moving resources around really is all this game has. Once you remove them, it's got nothing!\n\nIt's such a weird game. It has the graphics of a childs Nintendo game from about 10 years ago, but the tedium and complexity of a grown up simulator. It seems the game was made for an audience that never existed. 9 year old beurocrats and accountants!\nIt's also shuddery, even on a powerful system! \n\nHate is a strong word, but it's pretty fitting! How this got \"mostly positive\" I will never know. You guys have LOOOOOW standards! Or you are all evil geniuses, that wanted others to suffer as you did! Damn yee!!\n\nI so wish I had trusted my gut and refunded this garbage asap.

Serves Betheseda right.\n\nBut this is not about Bethesda, no not those greedy, back-stabbing fucks. No, this is about Hello Games, and, more specifically, No Man's Sky. \n\nWhat is No Man's Sky? Well, at it's core, it's an exploration game. A space exploration game. Oh, and, it's multiplayer too. Yes, right now you cannot \"customize\" your \"character\" (although to call the little orb thing that respresents you a character is an insult to most), however I have faith that Hello Games will implement something of the sort soon enough. \n\nWow, can't believe I just said that. Hello Games? Faith? Ridiculous! And to be honest, a year ago I'd have agreed. But this isn't a year ago. And holy (excuse my french) SHIT how much has changed.\n\nTo give you a bit of backstory, I was one of those people that didn't really buy into the hype. I saw one of the trailers and went, \"Hey, this looks interesting. I think I'll get it.\" Yes, I was one of those suckers who pre-ordered, and yes I was let down. I can't imagine the betrayal people who were on the hype train felt when they got a glitchy, unoptimized, empty, boring game, and I can't blame any of them for either refunding, or uninstalling the game and never thinking/touching it again. I was one of them.\n\nBut then... I got an upgrade to my PC, an upgrade which allowed me to play more graphics-intensive games (think DOOM 2016, Assassin's Creed: Syndicate, ESO, etc.). I discovered that No Man's SKy was on PC (I had had it on console .-.) aaaaaaaand went fuck you. \n\nYet, here I am, with only 10 or so hours in the (PC version of) the game, leaving a positive review and (apparently) my life story (sorry). I bought NMS thinking I'd try it and then refund it, but then actually found myself enjoying it. It's gone from a kind-of nice looking walking/flying simulator (and a shitty simulator at that), to a living, breathing, enjoyable game. Its 30-minute story has changed to nearly 10+ hours (which, for a multiplayer sandbox, is pretty good), tons of the previous annoying glitches have been ironed out, there are Quality of Life improvements everywhere, new features such as base building, faction wars, and yes, multiplayer have been added, and more. I'm impressed, to say the least. It's changed into the game we were promised a year ago, and to that I say... better late than never.\n\nThink about it, Hello Games coulda taken our money and run. They coulda dissappeared from the radar and we'd have never heard from them again. But they stayed. They worked, and made a good game. They fullfilled their promises, and show no signs of slowing down, something that most AAA publishers nowadays don't even consider. Bravo, Hello. Bravo.\n\nIn conclusion, this game is worth the buy. However, if you can wait, I'd reccommend getting it on sale. Less money that way. It's a fun little thing to hop into if you're tired and just want to relax, or if you're looking for a satisfying progression system in the form of mining/selling/buying that keeps you engaged for hours. It's fun if you're looking for a relatively short, kind of complex storyline that'll make you \"What?\" on the odd occaision. It's also a lot of fun when you're high (seriously, smoke a blunt then hit the Hyperdrive, you'll go to space. Literally.).\n\nGet it. Play it. Become a part of our little community. We're always looking for more. :)\n\n\n\n\nOh, the optimization is still shit though. It sucks but... they're working on it. :/", "upvoted": true, "time_of_review_unix": 1507944361, "upvotes_window": 99, "total_window": 148, "percent_window": 0.668918918918919, "neu_sent": 0.748, "neg_sent": 0.083, "pos_sent": 0.169, "comp_sent": 0.9949, "neu_window": 0.7061476510067116, "neg_window": 0.10648993288590597, "pos_window": 0.18063758389261758, "comp_window": 0.40234228187919446, "percent_window_roc": 0.7794599656625566, "neu_window_roc": 0.9622629200470031, "neg_window_roc": 0.37480640165203927, "pos_window_roc": 0.6577181208053692, "comp_window_roc": 0.8300359712230215, "1day_forecast": -0.02064305684995349, "1day_delta": 0.011200798113549792, "pos_predict": 0.08593285318057917, "neg_predict": 0.19672897611388443}, {"time_of_review": "2017-10-15T04:58:25", "review": "played for 3 hours, still dont know what im doing.....", "upvoted": true, "time_of_review_unix": 1508043505, "upvotes_window": 92, "total_window": 143, "percent_window": 0.6433566433566433, "neu_sent": 0.769, "neg_sent": 0.0, "pos_sent": 0.231, "comp_sent": 0.34, "neu_window": 0.7048541666666668, "neg_window": 0.10859722222222218, "pos_window": 0.179576388888889, "comp_window": 0.38619166666666666, "percent_window_roc": 0.7698643410852712, "neu_window_roc": 0.9584533381335253, "neg_window_roc": 0.3878205128205129, "pos_window_roc": 0.65625, "comp_window_roc": 0.8225669464428457, "1day_forecast": -0.02291868715226375, "1day_delta": -0.025562275562275638, "pos_predict": 0.07564995131516228, "neg_predict": 0.19595841623301635}, {"time_of_review": "2017-10-16T03:47:49", "review": "I never played this game before the Atlas patch, which is when I picked it up on sale.

It looks cool on the surface, but in terms of game design it over reaches and fails to be successful in any one area.\n\nThe primary gameplay aspect is inventory management. You'll never have enough space. Even if you find the ressource(s) you want at the moment, you'll use them up immediately. Sometimes it can take hours to find an item you've previously thrown away because it was a waste of space at that moment.\n\nI had to give up on trying to do missions, as they wouldn't always work (non existent objective targets) and they're little more than fetch quests.\n\nWhile upgrading your ship/suit/multitool should be exciting, it's so rare and so miniscule that it hardly features as a main aspect of the game. For my 30ish hours, I only changed ships 3 times, multitools 3 times, and the only suit upgrades I sought out were inventory space. The ships and multitools I saw were WAAAY out of my price range. \n\nBase building is kind of fun, except that it acts as a tether. Okay, so you build a base on planet A. Then you warp jump 6 times. So now what? You teleport back to your base? meaning all your warping was pointless. Or you start a new base... only to warp further away and need to build another base. \n\nSpace is bad. It's not good. There is no solar system navigation. There is no evidence that the planets orbit stars. Would you like to fly into a sun? That would be cool, wouldn't it? HAhahahahaha THERE ARE NO SUNS. \n\nSpace battling is bad. Pirates will randomly appear to steal your cargo, chasing you around, inhibiting your ability to warp or even run away to a nearby planet. Fighting them is about as elegant and graceful as a dog chasing it's own tail.\n\nA big issue I have is when you're on the planet surface, in your roamer, and you scan for a destination. It is ENTIRELY IMPRACTICAL TO TRAVEL IN YOUR ROAMER. Destinations are often 20 minutes away. If you really want to go to them, the only reasonable way is to take off in your ship and fly there, which is janky. \n\nThe transition from space to planet is janky, so janky. Flying straight towards a point creates an angled approach, which kind of makes sense, except you slow down in the atmosphere, and it creates a problem where you're somehow never going to reach your destination. I nearly always have to approach to generate the planet's surface, then fly back out of the atmosphere and approach from directly above the landing site, flying straight into the ground because there is no physical reason not to nosedive into the ground.\n\n\nThe most fun I had was using a roamer to jump around, and using the terrain manipulator to build ramps and stuff. \n\nOverall, I'd say it's an unsalvagable game because too many of its essential aspects are 2/5.", "upvoted": false, "time_of_review_unix": 1508806772, "upvotes_window": 75, "total_window": 123, "percent_window": 0.6097560975609756, "neu_sent": 0.806, "neg_sent": 0.09, "pos_sent": 0.105, "comp_sent": 0.7229, "neu_window": 0.701556451612903, "neg_window": 0.13213709677419358, "pos_window": 0.1582338709677419, "comp_window": 0.3379217741935484, "percent_window_roc": 0.6556264066016504, "neu_window_roc": 0.9401427670010026, "neg_window_roc": 0.5322580645161291, "pos_window_roc": 0.5645161290322581, "comp_window_roc": 0.6742863773497331, "1day_forecast": 0.0069105691056911, "1day_delta": -0.013194722111155577, "pos_predict": 0.27522644686603004, "neg_predict": 0.05480994501868903}, {"time_of_review": "2017-10-25T03:48:15", "review": "As big as the ocean but as shallow as a puppies piss puddle when it comes to content...

And I choose to review No Man\u2019s Sky.\n Games are entertainment right? A lot of games we play are based on this fact. Another fact though is we get excited for games that do more than just entertainment. They immerse us. They challenge our imaginations and take us to other worlds. No Man\u2019s Sky is a game that does this really well for me. I often get hyped for games like open world RPGS, games that dare me to live in a virtual world that corresponds with creativity. When I saw a trailer for No Man\u2019s Sky I was very impressed with its art. Now the gameplay trailer for E3 was gorgeous (and I just re watched it on YouTube to help with this review) and the game comes very close to what I saw in the trailer. Now I haven\u2019t encountered 100 percent of the experience in my 60+ hours (plus another 40 on PS4) it still delivered that scope of space mixed with a Pink Floyd like art style. Sandboxes like these are rare, and this one is also unique. Do I recommend it? I have really got my money\u2019s worth, but I knew what this game was going into it. No Man\u2019s Sky can be boring, or lonely or even not 100 percent what you expect. Games like this are perfect for me, and I encourage you if you like it, take it all in. It\u2019s a special game.

Some people  find the story boring but let me say, it does not have a great start, it goes off a bit slow, but once you reach a certain part you will start to get the feels on how the travellers feel, on how existence is for them.

Check out my screenshots to see some neat stuff. \nMy six year old son has started playing in Creative mode and loves it. He always asks to play No Man's Sky over all his LEGO games. \n\nUpdate 2 - \nI started a Creative game and have been pleasently surprised. I thought I would get bored within an hour because everything is free to build and charge (unlimited resources), but no, the freedom to ignore resources have given me a little boost in my hunt for unique biomes and interesting creatures and vistas. \nWith Creative Mode you still have story progression and you still have to acquire blueprints in the normal way.

The game is good, and worth buying if the following apply:\n\nThe game should be on sale. I bought the game when it was drastically reduced, and I can say it is not worth a full price tag by any means. I think I paid $20 for it and that was well worth it at that price point.\n\nYou enjoy exploration/survival games. I could play Minecraft for hours. Just zoning out and building bases or exploring dark caves really appeals to me. Much in the same way people like to relax and play Truck Simulator, I can sit down and zone out to the peaceful music of No Man's Sky while exploring planets and gathering materials. If you are looking for a deep and compelling story this is not really the game for you.\n\nYou are not looking for an engaging multiplayer experience. This game is not built for multiplayer, despite what people may have thought or may have been advertised. From what I know it is possible to go to other players bases, but I have not done so. In my travels I have never encountered another player and I think that is by game design but I could be wrong.\n\nAs long as those three guidlines are in effect I would advise you to grab the game. It is relaxing and fun for me to zip around the universe and discover new planets. After the first 20 hours or so you will begin to see that most of the planets are quite similar to ones previously visited with minor differences, however every once in a while I will make a discovery that makes me want to keep going. Base building is a cool feature for you to store some of your crafting materials and gives you a place of your own in the universe. The developers put out some pretty frequent updates that seem to consistently make improvements to the game which is a good sign to me. I have noticed that the game has occassional glitches that sometimes can be a major problem, but it has not hindered me enough to stop playing. This seems rather reccurent with PC games, so I just try to overlook anything not game breaking.\n\nMoral of the story: for the great deal I got on the game and the amount of exploration and resource gathering available I am happy with my purchase.", "upvoted": true, "time_of_review_unix": 1511310645, "upvotes_window": 65, "total_window": 97, "percent_window": 0.6701030927835051, "neu_sent": 0.829, "neg_sent": 0.032, "pos_sent": 0.14, "comp_sent": 0.9911, "neu_window": 0.700387755102041, "neg_window": 0.10178571428571428, "pos_window": 0.1876326530612245, "comp_window": 0.38799795918367336, "percent_window_roc": 0.6679639297579497, "neu_window_roc": 0.9297775992672359, "neg_window_roc": 0.46624803767660916, "pos_window_roc": 0.6428571428571429, "comp_window_roc": 0.710982234620467, "1day_forecast": 0.04027942087769709, "1day_delta": 0.013853092783505105, "pos_predict": 0.3473974795557883, "neg_predict": 0.006167212794164831}, {"time_of_review": "2017-11-23T00:20:53", "review": "really not that bad, plus it keep getting better and better after every update", "upvoted": true, "time_of_review_unix": 1511396453, "upvotes_window": 129, "total_window": 180, "percent_window": 0.7166666666666667, "neu_sent": 0.552, "neg_sent": 0.0, "pos_sent": 0.448, "comp_sent": 0.8366, "neu_window": 0.691204419889503, "neg_window": 0.09126519337016575, "pos_window": 0.21202762430939237, "comp_window": 0.4443331491712708, "percent_window_roc": 0.7058203777463702, "neu_window_roc": 0.9327993009223131, "neg_window_roc": 0.4768380790480238, "pos_window_roc": 0.6767955801104973, "comp_window_roc": 0.7410320362494535, "1day_forecast": -0.0011737089201877549, "1day_delta": 0.04656357388316157, "pos_predict": 0.42981237597060723, "neg_predict": 0.011865111507061736}, {"time_of_review": "2017-11-24T00:00:43", "review": "When I first bought the game, I had no illusions about its gameplay; I expected a space-based, resource management, walking simulator, with the ability to blast over to other planets to walk some more. I didn't really buy into the hype, and was pleasantly surprised (after the first week of patches). \nThis is not a true sim by any means; it is a much more meditative experience, and doesn't require your constant engagement. It also runs on my toaster of a laptop at a \"good enough\" 25-35fps, without noticeable stutters.\n\nIt's a very niche game, and at $60, it warrants its controversy; it doesn't really do anything new, and doesn't do anything thoroughly, except creating planets for you to explore. Mile wide and inch deep, sure, but that mile sure is wide. The data logs you find from abandoned buildings and monoliths weave an intricate story, the slow acquisition of languages and reliance on context clues to talk with the alien races have me running around to learn as much as possible. \n\nI've spent 23 hours on this game so far, and I've not yet left my starter planet; there's still tons to explore and loads to do, you just have to create your own depth.\n\n**Update**\nAt 42 hours, I finally redeemed the pre-order ship, after entering my second system.

The space battles with pirates are exhilirating, as I weave through asteroids and fumble my way through the ship inventory (Hello Games, fix this) to recharge my shields before exploding into dust.\n\n**Update 2**\nIt's been a year since release, and with 200+ hours it's still pretty engaging. HG keeps pushing out major content updates (Hello \"multiplayer\") that actually adds to the game, as opposed just cosmetic fixes and/or irrelevant patches.\n\n**Update 3**\nThe game remains engaging even after I've reached the center of a few galaxies and warped to the next. It would be nice to see a little more flora/fauna variety, (you get a bunch of repeating shapes b/c of procgen) and maybe more customization options. The devs have continued to listen and push out major updates (akin to DLC) for free, as well as continually optimizing the game and listening to player feedback. Audio and visual are top-notch, and it remains my go-to relaxation game.", "upvoted": true, "time_of_review_unix": 1511481643, "upvotes_window": 254, "total_window": 355, "percent_window": 0.7154929577464789, "neu_sent": 0.829, "neg_sent": 0.025, "pos_sent": 0.146, "comp_sent": 0.9928, "neu_window": 0.6868033707865177, "neg_window": 0.09199438202247187, "pos_window": 0.21840449438202253, "comp_window": 0.44321123595505624, "percent_window_roc": 0.7325450744708648, "neu_window_roc": 0.925936812753409, "neg_window_roc": 0.45635263612791704, "pos_window_roc": 0.7176966292134832, "comp_window_roc": 0.7633073316627597, "1day_forecast": 0.004771359434137867, "1day_delta": -0.0011737089201877549, "pos_predict": 0.27105389464189966, "neg_predict": 0.008704315453595157}, {"time_of_review": "2017-11-25T00:10:39", "review": "Bruh...

Which at the time despite everything that was going on, and everything that was said, written, read about etcetera, it wasn't all that super bad. Even back then NMS did sort of look amazing and promised a very unique voyage through the unknown. With some sort of loose plot stringing all its dysfunctioning parts together like the matriarch of your local family of drunken ne'erdowells (Let's face it, we all know one, somewhere close by). Yet despite all that NMS had to offer it just couldn't seem to get it together in terms of gameplay. And even one year on with all of NMSs flashy add ons, story campaign and its notable graphical update. It still does slip here and there. But improved it undoubtedly has.\n\nI did previously delete a 60 hour game save in order to start from scratch. So as to enjoy the NMS experience from the very beginning. In some aspects I really wish I hadn't. Having to build everything up from the ground again has been nothing short of brain numbing. And this time around, with all the additions there is so much more to build up. And any progress is hampered by the need to go in search of the necessary stuff so you can recharge / refuel all of your crap every 5 minutes. In this regard the starting portion of the game hasn't changed one bit. And having been through it before, it would seem that no amount of additional content is going to inspire me to sit through it all again, in order to get back to where I was in the game before on my previous ver 1.0 save.\n\nThis does raise a very serious point in my eyes, about the way this game was released. Something which does bring the whole Early Access thing into disrepute too. Though perhaps with a slight difference. Now I have bought Early Access before. I have a couple in my library at the moment, waiting to be played. Games that have caught my interest and have picked up due to being on sale and wotnot. But I won't be touching them, NOT until the titles have seen an official release, as I can't be doing with all the chopping and changing, rebalancing blah-de-blah-blah (you get the picture). Then you have something like NMS come along. Prattling on how it's all finished and ready to play and that. Except when you get it, turns out it isn't and you put the time in anyway even though there still so much more content to come... It's just that it's 6-12 months away. \n\nTHIS ! This kind of shit really bakes my beans. I saw this not once but twice last year. Firstly with No Man's Sky and then again with Streum Ons' Space Hulk Deathwing. Both games I am now completely struggling to be interested in. Even though both have improved no end since release. Though neither have been really acceptabley good enough to warrant a return to experience the game in how it should have been at release. No matter how good they are becoming now, the damage has already been done in most respects. No Mans Sky may have taken my money, but it'll never have my fanship, appreciation or love. Something which for certain, it would have definitely had if the game had released in the state that it is currently in. \n\nUnfortunately time has moved on, more games have been released since and NMS is by far nowhere near the best game of its muddled genres on Steam. As a space game it's fair to middling, don't be jumping into this expecting some great simulation, because it isn't here. Saying anything along those lines would be like comparing [i]Microsoft Flight Simulator X[/i] to [i]Afterburner[/i]. It's all very basic and arcadey. Though that said, a dog fight can be amazingly  fast paced. Which isn't all that bad. It does rather shine in its exploration portion (As should be expected). Yet falls with it's survival / menu management parts, which are still as annoying as they are abyssmal as when they were first released (only now there is more, more, more of it). And it's this last section of the game that I can't get on with at all. And having to start from scratch again. I am finding it really difficult to drum up enough interest to continue with the daily chore of progression. It all just seems like unnecessary hard work just to get anywhere and with little to no reward for all the faffing around that is needed. \n\nThere hasn't been all much done in regards to NMS repitition problem either. I'm only just [b]six[/b] systems and 30ish hours in on this new playthrough and I already feel that I may as well as have stayed in the first system for all the differentiation that NMS has on offer. Plants seem to repeat much more frequently than animals. But the animals repitition is more to do with the parts that they are made from, rather than the actual creature themselves. And they are an odd concoction too. Almost like SOUTH PARKs Dr. Mephestos creations, stopping just short (but only just, mind), of his \"monkey with five arses\".\n\nThough if I'd bought the game recently and was starting with a fresh set of eyes, there is nothing to say that I wouldn't be gushing over this right now. If anything NMS is stunningly beautiful and offers a surreal science fiction that no other game has (certainly of recent years anyway). It sits in that weird bracket of Sci-Fi, between that of the 1950's, (Invaders From Mars, Them, This Island Earth era) and Star Wars. When all Sci-Fi went unnecessarily oddball and far too existential for it's own good, The time of 2001, The Man Who Fell To Earth and Saturn 3 (A film so cheap and awful it couldn't even be saved by Farrah Fawcetts knockers). NMS reflects this era perfectly, right down to the sci-fi artistic stylings of the time. \n\nI would make a special nod to the Soundtrack which is a sublime musical collaboration. [b]65 Days of Static[/b] have done an incredible job on the OST. I even went and bought the double LP from Laced Records, I was that impressed. \n\nBy all means give it a try when it hits the sale. But you're not going to see all that is on offer in those first 2 hours. But whether those first 2 hours will inspire you enough to carry on past that [b]refund window[/b] is anyones guess. I tried it to a point, thought I'd wait for it to get better, to which it has. Believe me it has. Except in the places where it was needed for me to keep my interest for a second time around. You may be different. If I hadn't lost that initial momentum due to the awful release, that would be me as well. Unfortunately now however, I am not at all sure if I'll be carrying on. At the time of writing I'm not sure if I can really be arsed. But we'll see. It doesn't look that hopeful though. Like I said, there's new games coming out all the time and as a gamer in this modern environment, I have to ask. Who really has the time to give to any old dross that is desperate for a second look cos it couldn't quite get it right a year ago ?\n\nThere's a moral in here somewhere, I wonder if anyone in this broken industry will pick up on it.\n(I doubt it  LOL)\n\nHOWEVER ! At the risk of contradicting myself (but I'm going to do it anyway), a bit of digging away at it is continuing to reveal a fair bit of depth. Something which, having somewhat of a skeptical second look at this game, I would not have initially given it credit for and has come as a complete suprise. I don't want to say I'm going to end up revisiting the review section to give a third opinion here. But it could very well turn out like this. As NMS seems to have some hard to reach layers, that once revealed. Show all the hallmarks of one heck of a beautiful genre defining title. Only time is going to tell whether this will be the case or not.

I've loved this game from the very beginning, and stuck with it through lots of drama. Now, this game has many negative reviews, plenty which have valid points (like things shown in trailers not being included in game), but the devs have (in my opinion) made up for this by adding things in updates, like freighters, bases, an interesting economy system, new ships, new planets, and a giant story.\n\nIf you are looking for an action packed space sim, this is not the game you're going to want. No Man's Sky has lots of traveling, be it walking, flying, or warping across star systems, so it can get boring pretty easily. The main highlights of the game are when you are finally able to get that beautiful ship you've been looking for, finding harmless beautiful planets, finding interesting looking creatures, building your own base, coming across another player's base, and finally finding other players. Unfortunately these moments are far and few, but when they happen they are very exciting.\n\nAll in all, I would definetly recommend this game.\n\nNote: It is a bit pricy for what it is, so if you are going to buy this game, you'd probably want to buy it when it's on sale.", "upvoted": true, "time_of_review_unix": 1513677327, "upvotes_window": 59, "total_window": 107, "percent_window": 0.5514018691588785, "neu_sent": 0.757, "neg_sent": 0.068, "pos_sent": 0.175, "comp_sent": 0.9835, "neu_window": 0.7197500000000002, "neg_window": 0.10578703703703701, "pos_window": 0.1559444444444445, "comp_window": 0.3309824074074074, "percent_window_roc": 0.6158914728682171, "neu_window_roc": 0.9305372214888594, "neg_window_roc": 0.517094017094017, "pos_window_roc": 0.5833333333333334, "comp_window_roc": 0.6290217825739408, "1day_forecast": 0.03513659237958311, "1day_delta": -0.007156689399680061, "pos_predict": 0.12783600082822985, "neg_predict": 0.09921441879525596}, {"time_of_review": "2017-12-20T01:14:09", "review": "I can't remember the last time I was so hyped for a release as No Man's Sky. Maybe Diddy Kong Racing, or Final Fantasy IX, certainly nothing that came out this decade can compare to how excited I was for this game. And then it came out, and I when I opened the store page I found there was a notice about steam's refund policy. Huh?? And the reviews... Overwhelmingly negative. People actually felt like they were swindled. I didn't buy the game.\n\nI think there was a bandwagon effect. The only fashionable stance on this game was disdain. Like disco in the nineties and grunge in the noughties. Except this game had not yet lived its glory. I don't know how bad it was, but I think people are spoiled on games these days, and the thing is- I don't know by what.\n\n\nI have never seen a game that can match the technical achievement of NMS in terms of being able to go from inside a player built structure, to outside, to a space ship, fly around the atmosphere, take off, fly into space and travel to another planet all without any loading breaks. Awesome. The gameplay is a bit repetitive, but so is pac man and so is minecraft and both of them have done well. In many ways this game is a sci fi minecraft- except it does have a story.\n\n\n\nNow a year and change after release, I managed to pick this game up on sale, as the party line is shfting from hate to respect- and I wonder how much has changed about this game aside from expectations and zeitgeist. \n\n\nI've been playing it nonstop. At work I think about coming home to play this game. Its a grind, but I want more. The same way I felt about Diablo 2 LOD in middle school. \n\nSuper atmospheric, great music, the game is worth full price. On sale, you would be a complete fool not to buy it.\n\n...Just don't accidentally waste your first antimatter.\n\n\nAnd if anyone from HG reads this... One request/suggestion..please add some more visual filters that people may ACTUALLY want to use. The default look is cool, all the others are totally stupid.

I bought it when it first came out and, as with many others, was disappointed that it wasn't as \"deep\" as advertized.  Additionally, it was simply far too easy to progress.  Since launch a ton of new features have been added - there is an incredible amount to do and see, I've barely scratched the surface.\n\nWhile I tend to prefer more \"realistic\" space games (Elite Dangerous - I'm a backer with >1000 hours in Elite) there's simply no denying that there's more to do in NMS.  Since starting Survival mode (for tougher difficulty) I've probably spent 10 hours on 1 planet alone; one with no wildlife but a milder climate that allowed me to explore in relative peace and hunt for bigger and better ships.  And NPC difficulty has been upped too - I love getting my rear end kicked by low level space pirates in my low level ship; that's the way it should be.  All in all: I recommend this game to anyone who likes variety, exploration, a space theme, a bit of a challenge and the constant thrill associated with finding better stuff.  I believe there are hundreds if not thousands of hours worth of content to anyone who doesn't want to race through a game....

Its strength is pretty much in the fact that there aren't many other space-themed exploration sandboxes. Of those sandboxes, this is probably the best available at present. Unlike Elite Dangerous, NMS lets you land everywhere and explore everything, without having to be in the cockpit of a vehicle. (Getting out of the cockpit is highly underrated.) Unlike Space Engineers, Evochron Legacy or Empyrion, there's way more to explore and no danger of some griefer blowing up your work or ruining your progress for lulz. \n\nOwning a capital ship with a basebuilding component is a nice positive. I'm hoping one day to find a USS Enterprise mod for it, but if I don't, NBD since I got one that looks like a Star Wars destroyer. \n\nIt'll get a little repetitive after a while, but I was pretty impressed with the number of assets available.

You make your own fate, choose how fast or slow you progress, how much or little you wish to explore.\n\nI know the game and its developer had, and maybe still has, a bad reputation, but I always loved it, right from the get go. I never bought into the disgruntled, angry attitude a lot of people had, because in my eyes it wasn't fully justified to the extend it happened, but that's the past, and regardless of what happened at launch, with the huge updates, fixes, listening to the community, and putting the game at where it is now, Hello Games have redeemed themselves.\n\nThere are other games of similar, or maybe better (different) quality out there, but I still keep coming back to No Man's Sky, and not any of the others. I play this on a mid-range rig, and it runs well.\n\nIf you enjoy mostly chill exploration games with a beautiful sci-fi art style and literally an entire universe to see, then waste no more time, and go give it a try.\n\nThe Path of the Atlas awaits.

Objectively...\n\n- When released it was a mere shell of it's promises Pretty fun still. Bit overpriced\n- Where games usually dwindle down after a backlash, the people behind the schenes actually worked on improving it, worked on adding what was missing, however slowly, and added things they hadn't announced before... \n- So far hasn't added a price tag on dlc or new content, and Steam lowered its price in sales as well. \n- Now, two years later... another content update is still coming, where other games are actually.. dead\n\n\n- This game does the exact opposite of any other game. \n- Instead of hyping PR for more income, they went silent\n- Instead of letting this game die, they keep on working on it\n- Instead of letting us pay more, they deliver with no monetary expectations. \n\nSo I'd like to ask any other gamer out there who has a junkyard of unplayed steam game and ask you this.....\n\nAre you unhappy that your wallet is not being drained while you got this game in there, and you resent that it has replay value due to added content? \n\n\nSo let me simply thank the small team of game creators for making this game No Man's Sky almost 2 years ago.\n\n60 hours put into it.

No, I'm not in the middle of the universe, I just don't have fun anymore. I pushed myself to have fun in the game until now. It worked over 40 hours, but the world is just to lifeless and static.\n\nAt this moment, I can't recommend the game anymore,  I hope so much this game will get better and more features we were promised.

I didn't start over from scratch, but I did play through the official Atlas Elevates quest line. It's not unfortunate. Without spoiling it, I can verbally express you will learn a lot about the backstory of the three sapient lifeforms, and your own story as well. It will additionally introduce the beginning mission system and some incipient factions.\n\nAs I mentioned in my aperture tirade, the incipient update resets an abundance of what came afore. The planet engenderer has been revamped, and in the process, all antecedent planets were regenerated. That pulchritudinous, lush paradise, that was your favorite hang-out? Gone -- superseded by an incipiently engendered world. It might still be nice or might be a wasteland. That is categorically exasperating in the world where you secure your base. And if you built components of your base outside the defined boundary, those components will be gone, additionally.\n\nThe worlds you discovered and designated still subsist -- marginally. You discovered them; They're on your list, and yet you must re-discover them again. When you scan for creatures, the historic ones you observed afore are still listed, but they are not around anymore, and there are incipient ones. It's authentically extraordinary.\n\nI'm not sure why the discovered worlds couldn't have been preserved. Resetting them considers no impact on incipient players, but it's upsetting to the veterans who've devoted the most time playing, and the most time fortifying this game. It seems short-sighted.\n\nI was so dejected about the transmutations to my habitation planet that I decided to move away. Far, a long way away. After completing the Atlas Elevating quest, I peregrinated all the way out to the 10th galaxy, which is denominated Eissentam. The No Man's Welkin' Gamepedia reports it seems to have a more astronomically immense number of lush planets that other galaxies, which I cerebrated sounded nice. I found a pretty place to build an incipient base and am settling in quite well.\n\n[quote=author] Tanner Golden\t[/quote]\n\n[b] HARDWARE REQ\t[/b]\nRequires a 64-bit processor and operating system\nOS: Windows 7/8.1/10 (64-bit versions)\nProcessor: Intel Core i3\nMemory: 8 GB RAM\nGraphics: nVidia GTX 480, AMD Radeon 7870\nStorage: 10 GB available space\n\n\u2611 [b] Reccomended\t[/b]\n\n[b] GAMEPLAY\t[/b]\n\u2610 (8.0-10)\n\u2611 (6.0-7.9)\n\u2610 (4.0-5.9)\n\u2610 (2.0-3.9)\n\u2610 (0-1.9)\n\n[b] GRAPHICS\t[/b]\n\u2610 (8.0-10) MASTERPIECE\n\u2611 (6.0-7.9) GREAT\n\u2610 (4.0-5.9) OKAY\n\u2610 (2.0-3.9) AWFUL\n\u2610 (0-1.9) DISASTER\n\n[b] ONLINE\t[/b]\n\u2610 (8.0-10)\n\u2610 (6.0-7.9)\n\u2610 (4.0-5.9)\n\u2611 (2.0-3.9)\n\u2610 (0-1.9)\n\n[h1][b] OVERALL RATING\t[/b][/h1]\n\n\u2611 [b] 73.5\t[/b]", "upvoted": true, "time_of_review_unix": 1525048155, "upvotes_window": 55, "total_window": 84, "percent_window": 0.6547619047619048, "neu_sent": 0.807, "neg_sent": 0.068, "pos_sent": 0.125, "comp_sent": 0.9833, "neu_window": 0.6923294117647059, "neg_window": 0.1194, "pos_window": 0.17642352941176473, "comp_window": 0.33410352941176474, "percent_window_roc": 0.6086456908344733, "neu_window_roc": 0.8985705310565363, "neg_window_roc": 0.6570135746606336, "pos_window_roc": 0.5764705882352942, "comp_window_roc": 0.5738044858231062, "1day_forecast": 0.019936890418818076, "1day_delta": 0.011083743842364546, "pos_predict": 0.4882426719137413, "neg_predict": 0.0011222066585873487}, {"time_of_review": "2018-05-01T14:11:28", "review": "For me this is a good  game,\nI am quite hardcore when it comes to game, which means I have not googled anything about it(except I cheated and googled since I didn't find any map key/functionality, but there is not such thing in game)\nI have around 80 hours in game after just over a week and a half now, so something must the game do right :-)\n\nFor me it's a low intensity explorer game, very little adrenaline, just pure exploration, discovery of planets fauna, Flora etc.\nI have just started doing missions :-)\n\nFor me it really brought me back to Elite on c64, but more polished and lacking in some other aspects.\nI strongly recommend this game for a narrow group of people which are hard core explorers, other groups I don't know if they find this game interesting.", "upvoted": true, "time_of_review_unix": 1525183888, "upvotes_window": 56, "total_window": 80, "percent_window": 0.7, "neu_sent": 0.82, "neg_sent": 0.044, "pos_sent": 0.135, "comp_sent": 0.9224, "neu_window": 0.7011851851851851, "neg_window": 0.10767901234567903, "pos_window": 0.17869135802469135, "comp_window": 0.3901234567901235, "percent_window_roc": 0.6126327878265863, "neu_window_roc": 0.8933157326293051, "neg_window_roc": 0.6267806267806267, "pos_window_roc": 0.5617283950617284, "comp_window_roc": 0.5806354916067146, "1day_forecast": 0.005128205128205221, "1day_delta": 0.029268292682926744, "pos_predict": 0.6932851508089926, "neg_predict": 0.0025914496414728566}, {"time_of_review": "2018-05-02T16:02:42", "review": "i wish i liked it more", "upvoted": false, "time_of_review_unix": 1525276962, "upvotes_window": 53, "total_window": 76, "percent_window": 0.6973684210526315, "neu_sent": 0.267, "neg_sent": 0.0, "pos_sent": 0.733, "comp_sent": 0.6705, "neu_window": 0.713077922077922, "neg_window": 0.09318181818181817, "pos_window": 0.18063636363636362, "comp_window": 0.44055324675324686, "percent_window_roc": 0.6307459981878586, "neu_window_roc": 0.9049172356504649, "neg_window_roc": 0.5934065934065934, "pos_window_roc": 0.5909090909090909, "comp_window_roc": 0.5881762122769317, "1day_forecast": -0.011654135338345806, "1day_delta": 0.00601039636127354, "pos_predict": 0.4931867608208492, "neg_predict": 0.04061253593054959}, {"time_of_review": "2018-05-03T09:12:24", "review": "Refunded on SALES...

You can only store your items in there but that is really unneccesary considering the fact that you keep traveling further on so you can get to the middle of the universe of whatever, so you would basically just leave your items there for all eternity.\n\nAlot of other comments tell people to try to give it a go again.

To my disappointment I wasn't able to tab out of the game and have it keep running like doing so to an MMO would. Tl;dr my plans didn't work out the way I wanted to but the game is still good. Just figured I'd leave a review along with things I wish to see implemented:\n\n- ability to tab out and have the game still running so that travelling could be casual instead of tedious\n- animals with fur (I haven't seen any so far, just dinosaur like creatures, with some semblance of mammal shapes. They're all the same material, could do with more material differentiaton)\n- ability to build a base anywhere, not just habitable bases. Sometimes there's an ocean or mountains and it sucks when none of the bases have the right view\n- more terrain extremes, higher mountain ranges, lower valleys\n- third person option, FPS games tend to make me dizzy after a while, and I'd like be able to see the traveler do things like sit, nap, idle and etc\n- more tree variety, width and height mainly. Normally on a nice planet they'll be too equally spread out and too equal in height. It would be nice to see them in clusters, and have smaller shrubs to complement them\n- alien architectures, or villages of some sort where you can see NPCS roaming and living and stuff. Things to make the planet feel livelier. Maybe the ability to ayattract different NPCS to your base\n- the ability to choose which galaxy you get dumped in, at the beginning of the game\n- submarine would be neat\n- terrain builder being more permanent\n\nNow I know the team is consistently updating, which is a good thing and I applaud the effort! Other pros include the music change when landing, super cool, that. Language system is pretty cool. The newer storylines are much better. The new land rides are cool.

But I feel if No Man's Sky was released in it's current state with No Man's Sky Next it would be getting rave reviews from players and critics alike. Some would even consider it a game of the year.\nHello Games should have waited longer as this game needed more time to bake in the oven. But something truly special is here if you dig through all the hate of almost two years ago.\n\nHello games is still working hard on this game, there is no microtransaction or a free to play system. They have done their best to turn this game around. Honestly in this day in age that doesn't happen much by many developers. Especially if there are no microtransactions and loot boxes.\n\nSo I think Hello Games deserves a lot of cedit turning this ship around, regardless of the lies and fumbles made by the developer. They are giving us tons of free content that always would sell as DLC. So right now the game makes up for the disappointment.\n\nWith No Man's Sky Next Launch I will say the game with worth 59.99 for sure and if you can get it on sale even better. Sounds like a small version of Star Shitizen only No Man's Sky really exists.", "upvoted": true, "time_of_review_unix": 1527033666, "upvotes_window": 101, "total_window": 137, "percent_window": 0.7372262773722628, "neu_sent": 0.716, "neg_sent": 0.116, "pos_sent": 0.168, "comp_sent": 0.9666, "neu_window": 0.737905797101449, "neg_window": 0.08023188405797099, "pos_window": 0.17460869565217396, "comp_window": 0.3502891304347825, "percent_window_roc": 0.6656218402426693, "neu_window_roc": 0.9709953615535926, "neg_window_roc": 0.4414715719063545, "pos_window_roc": 0.5833333333333334, "comp_window_roc": 0.5932580022938172, "1day_forecast": 0.029897010298970073, "1day_delta": 0.03352257366855904, "pos_predict": 0.11717271357837297, "neg_predict": 0.001704929367864403}, {"time_of_review": "2018-05-24T00:50:13", "review": "this game is a wast of money DO NOT BUY the controlls are bad the game is bad and there is not enought to do the screenshots are a lie and its bad in jeneral\n", "upvoted": false, "time_of_review_unix": 1527123013, "upvotes_window": 111, "total_window": 146, "percent_window": 0.7602739726027398, "neu_sent": 0.741, "neg_sent": 0.259, "pos_sent": 0.0, "comp_sent": -0.8885, "neu_window": 0.7408639455782313, "neg_window": 0.07934693877551019, "pos_window": 0.17297278911564634, "comp_window": 0.3662414965986394, "percent_window_roc": 0.6823287454516691, "neu_window_roc": 0.9753549325646496, "neg_window_roc": 0.41444270015698587, "pos_window_roc": 0.5714285714285714, "comp_window_roc": 0.5924851955170557, "1day_forecast": 0.021182981039644333, "1day_delta": 0.02114353782013112, "pos_predict": 0.11596679479242514, "neg_predict": 0.0035881805918562865}, {"time_of_review": "2018-05-25T01:27:16", "review": "The socks I jerked off into in my closet had a much more interesting universe to explore once I left them rotting in there for a couple years", "upvoted": false, "time_of_review_unix": 1527211636, "upvotes_window": 118, "total_window": 152, "percent_window": 0.7763157894736842, "neu_sent": 0.821, "neg_sent": 0.067, "pos_sent": 0.112, "comp_sent": 0.2944, "neu_window": 0.74, "neg_window": 0.07925490196078432, "pos_window": 0.1741830065359478, "comp_window": 0.3892705882352941, "percent_window_roc": 0.6969752241982063, "neu_window_roc": 0.9721377090377732, "neg_window_roc": 0.43137254901960786, "pos_window_roc": 0.5718954248366014, "comp_window_roc": 0.592020501246062, "1day_forecast": 0.003558424362793855, "1day_delta": 0.009192501802451347, "pos_predict": 0.12252255996949607, "neg_predict": 0.008280597935985802}, {"time_of_review": "2018-05-26T02:37:07", "review": "I got this game in the sale so i can't complain about the price but apart from that ive been loving the game and even more so that the developers are still working on it 1 year later despite all the negative reviews.

A dozen hours in I can say that all the original critisim is still valid. In many ways this game is similar with all that is wrong with Spore: the game has such a large breadth that it lacks any depth.\n\n- The fps component of shooting things is clunky and unrefined with no complexity or much in the way of strategy. You mine things by shooting them with a mining laser, you shoot sentials and animals by shooting them with killing lasers. What should be a key interaction with the enviornment is a chore.\n- Space flight is horrid, terrestial flight is worse. Really it's the flying that got me to give up on No Man's Sky. The controls feel like they got soaked in glue, and often flight behaves as if the game \"knows\" what I'm trying to do and shoves the ship there. This makes flying feel disjointed and unresponsive, you are a passenger driving the ship from the back seat. I tried mouse and keyboard, and I tried the controller the game was clearly designed for, I tried vanilla and I tried modded. No combination makes flight fun.\n- Fauna and flora fall into 4-5 categories depending on the planet type, and once you've a handful of systems you've seen it all. Sure glowy things are pretty, and mods make the night sky pretty, but after a couple of hours you've more or less seen it all. Considering that the rest of the game is a routine grind seeing what's around the next horizon becomes a tedious chore rather than something to look forward to. \n\nThe process of exploring, flying and walking, is bland.

A lot of these reviews were made at launch by people who probably haven't had a second glance at the game in a while. And while I cannot say it is perfect, it is very much improved since launch.\n\nAt the moment I've only played barely a day - but I can say for sure that this game [i]is not at the same stage as launch.[/i]\n\n[b]First of all, I want to address the developers -[/b]\nThese guys. These guys have had everything thrown at these from the beginning as this game has had a rocky start, but these guys have kept perservering to bring the playerbase that stuck around countless updates and have been working hard to bring things that they promised. They have been getting a lot of hate from comments and people just have to remember - they are people too, they have to get paid, they have to pay their bills, they have their own issues and their own families to deal with. Please, game developing isn't just making something magically appear out of thin air. It takes time, dedication and a hell of a lot of patience due to bug-fixes. It's up to the playerbase to help the devs make the game into what it can be, make ourselves heard and the developers will respond.\nI also wish to say that the developers [i]did not lie as such[/i]. As the hype train for NMS got longer, more and more people added what they wished to be in the game to the developer's workload, and rumours began circulating. The developers took a gamble - the played along with these rumours and this is what was make or break. Unfortunately, the \"promises\" were unrealistic for the release time - although, I believe had this game been released at about \u00a320 and in Early Access, it would not have had such harsh criticism for failing to deliver. Despite this however, the developers have brought many updates and implementations to the table, and the game is looking more and more promising.\n\n[b]The price-[/b]\nAlthough I cannot agree with the price still remaining at \u00a340/$60 or whatever, I can see why it still is - people have lost a lot of faith in the developers due to the bad launch, thus their income is reliant on people who purchase at full price or when it goes on sale. I bought it on sale for \u00a319.99 - and I must say, already, that I have had more fun than I paid for. Maybe if this game was at half the price it is, more people would give it a try.\n\nOf course, this does not mean NMS is for everyone, as no game ever is.\n\n[b]The game itself - [/b]\nThe game itself is great, especially with the implementations of base-building. I love my frozen-earth base looking over a cliff face I must say, but that isn't what makes this game great.\nWhat makes this game great is that although some planets may look similar, if you take a stroll on the surface, it may turn out to be completely different to what you had first imagined.\nOf course, some planets may look identical, but the fauna and flora may be different, the weather could be different and the \"Sentinels\" (basically the bad-guy robots who make sure you aren't MINING THAT PLUTONIUM OVER THERE MY GOOD SIR) can either be extremely laid-back to the point they come up to you when you're mining some of that sweet plutonium for your tools and launch thrusters and be like \"what ya doin'\" \"oh have a great day\" to being like a rabid dog that will hunt you down the moment it lays it's eyes on you.\nI also like that there's sort of \"levels\" of how much they want you dead. What's that? A single sentinel? Pffft. Easy to get rid of. However, it's amazing just how fast that sentinel can become... your worst nightmare.\nFauna and flora on planets that are alike can also grow in different ways however, I have only ever seen one type of animal on two different planets - every other animal I've seen so far has been different!\nThe only thing I don't like however is the lack of hostile animals and plants - how I'd love to land on a planet which looks very similar to Earth and go into a forest, only to step on the most toxic of plants while I'm being chased by a pack of dinosaur-deer hybrids with bear's heads.\nThe fauna itself can be a laugh sometimes, with some of them bouncing around like there's no tomorrow to even having flying animals looking like whales - I'd love to show you a screenshot of one I have.\nThere are also a few bugs but none are game-breaking, the worst one I've noticed so far is that if I even tap the ground slightly my ship seems to lose half of it's shield.\n\n[b]Base-building[/b]\nBase building is actually pretty neat, you can buy more blueprints to make your base more unique/interesting, and you can recruit certain people to do jobs for you and give you access to new technology and vehicles. However, I believe you can only build one home-base at a time, so try to build somewhere you will come back to/like.\nCurrently I have found no way to not rely on your life-support system in your base, which would be quite nice to have so I know I have a safe space in which I do not have to use up my life-support's battery.\n\n[b]Flying[/b]\nFlying at first can be pretty daunting and hard to understand as the controls are a bit analogue - you drag the mouse to steer the ship. However, if you ever feel like your flying skills may get you killed in a dogfight with some space-pirates or during a war, then just make sure you have plenty of Iron in your ship which you can get from asteroids, as it can help you charge your shields so you have more of a fighting chance.\nEvery different kind of ship seems to have a different interior, which is also pretty nice.\n\n[b]Graphics[/b]\nI play on low graphics as my rig is currently out of commission, so I literally only get 20 fps on low. However, this does not stop me playing as I have gotten used to it - and it even rockets back up to 60 whenever I'm in space, so I know I'm safe during dogfights.\nEven at low graphics everything looks beautiful, I'd die to see what the max settings would look like.\n\n[b]TL;DR[/b]\nDevs - Good job, I commend you on your hard work.\nThe price - Could be a little lower, however I understand how much work the devs have to do, perhaps get it on a sale.\nThe game itself - Very good, over 30 hours story, many side-missions and rewards for doing stuff for factions, freighters seem like they'll be amazing as you can have multiple ships on them so I'm looking forward to collecting those.\nBase-building - A lot of choice, even more if you're willing to spend some of those \"units\" - quite easily earned, although a bit limited to where you can build as you have to search for the corner stone - \"habitable bases\".\nFlying - Hard to master the controls, flying differs for each craft as some are easily handled compared to others. You can tell that some crafts are suited to certain roles.\n\n[b]Things I'm not sure about[/b]\nI don't know if there's a way to place a waypoint down on a planet at a particular point of interest (say, a crashed freighter or a portal), if there is it's probably along the base-building line, which is kind of sad as I've missed a lot of stuff out from my previous systems.\nShip controls are a bit weird for PC, although are quite easy to use with practice - currently though, I keep a lot of iron on me to prevent me dying against five attacking ships while I have no idea how to pull off some of those crazy stunts they do.\n\n[b]Overall, I reckon this game is a solid 8/10, with more updates it can become refined into what it should've been - a masterpiece.[/b]", "upvoted": true, "time_of_review_unix": 1530060135, "upvotes_window": 117, "total_window": 169, "percent_window": 0.6923076923076923, "neu_sent": 0.758, "neg_sent": 0.09, "pos_sent": 0.152, "comp_sent": 0.9987, "neu_window": 0.7169823529411762, "neg_window": 0.0873235294117647, "pos_window": 0.1839, "comp_window": 0.4433394117647058, "percent_window_roc": 0.732859097127223, "neu_window_roc": 0.9300993216199235, "neg_window_roc": 0.41809954751131223, "pos_window_roc": 0.6794117647058824, "comp_window_roc": 0.7070090986034702, "1day_forecast": -0.018274543136421517, "1day_delta": -0.0030565461029037344, "pos_predict": 0.07180946692027018, "neg_predict": 0.12162685552148794}, {"time_of_review": "2018-06-28T11:32:38", "review": "If you still have doubts and want to buy the game, get it on sale.

Leaving up old review because it was true at the time.  It no longer is.  Thank you for taking our money, receving no more, yet continuing to make the product not only better, but into a very good game.\n\nCurrent rating:  8/10.\n\nCould go higher with next update.\n\n***ORIGINAL REVIEW***\n\nIt is a lead bar coated in gold.  And sold to you as a solid gold bar.  Don't buy, wait until they deliver what promised.  If they never do, never buy.  The idea is amazing.  Sadly, it was not implemented properly.  If you are in super chill mode it is a 6/10 game.  If you want to actually accomplish something, it is a 2/10.\n\nNow I could buy it not having anything to accomplish if there was so much random stuff that you were doing new things all the time that didn't matter.  There just isn't enough variation and the game gets repetitive really fast.  I have 14 hours on record and carn't really imagine there being much more to the game as I have been watching the same thing over and over for the past 10 hours of gameplay.\n\nPROS:\n-Great concept\n-Beautiful color pallette\n-EMPTINESS (when chill)\n\nCONS:\n-Repetitive\n-Boring\n-Buggy and terrible optimization\n-Lots of things make no sense about it\n-EMPTINESS (when wanting to game)\n\n**UPDATE**\nI think you are going to see a lot of developers follow Murray's lead here and cash in.  Steam needs to change its 2 hour rule as it is apparent that NMS packed all of its content into a 2 hour window and after that it is just repetitive.  Most people will get to experience new things in the first 2 hours.  But after that you realize it is nothing but the same thing over and over so you can't get a refund.\n\nSo far, I would say this is the biggest con job in the history of gaming.

My brother wrote it off as being to repetitive and he lost interest pretty early on, and while I agree that many aspects of the game are repetitive I have no issues with that. I like having a clear and defined purpose. Eventually I stopped playing consistently and would only pick up the controller and play for a few hours when a new update hit. Last week though, I watched Close Encounters of the Third Kind for the first time and Roy's (the main character) wonder and amazement regarding the extraterrestrials made me want to dive back in and experience my own share of that wonder, because to this day some two years after the launch of No Man's Sky, I am still filled with wonder, at the scale of the game, the sights, to a lesser extent the sounds, the feeling of insignificance in a world that is virtual, it takes my breath away. And so I purchased the game on Steam as over the last two years I have shifted to PC gaming and now with NEXT only a few days away I feel that anyone who has ever looked up into the sky at night and seen the stars, and wondered what being amongst them would be like, should try this game.

But Sean and his team could've just taken our money and ran out the back door with it.\n[u] But they didn't.\t[/u]\n\nThank you Hello Games, for not giving up on what in many people's eyes was seen as a dead horse.", "upvoted": true, "time_of_review_unix": 1532822419, "upvotes_window": 5788, "total_window": 6607, "percent_window": 0.8760405630392009, "neu_sent": 0.78, "neg_sent": 0.079, "pos_sent": 0.142, "comp_sent": 0.8168, "neu_window": 0.702856083535109, "neg_window": 0.06144491525423703, "pos_window": 0.23207354721549658, "comp_window": 0.48389907687651135, "percent_window_roc": 0.926872993974886, "neu_window_roc": 0.9441460467135392, "neg_window_roc": 0.31961259079903154, "pos_window_roc": 0.7971398305084746, "comp_window_roc": 0.8308851707979863, "1day_forecast": -0.006705420569730003, "1day_delta": -0.010074881578583827, "pos_predict": 0.017422905064697788, "neg_predict": 0.004962605594001668}, {"time_of_review": "2018-07-30T00:00:47", "review": "dont even bother", "upvoted": false, "time_of_review_unix": 1532908847, "upvotes_window": 6407, "total_window": 7371, "percent_window": 0.8692172025505359, "neu_sent": 0.496, "neg_sent": 0.0, "pos_sent": 0.504, "comp_sent": 0.2584, "neu_window": 0.7030562940857302, "neg_window": 0.06203567552902845, "pos_window": 0.23165721649484564, "comp_window": 0.47896562669560294, "percent_window_roc": 0.9263435500763416, "neu_window_roc": 0.9440888324626853, "neg_window_roc": 0.3188572144079469, "pos_window_roc": 0.7985621269669018, "comp_window_roc": 0.8317296244393525, "1day_forecast": -0.0023368870075801684, "1day_delta": -0.006709563979952815, "pos_predict": 0.015761681573046138, "neg_predict": 0.0048395014623444825}, {"time_of_review": "2018-07-31T00:00:04", "review": "[EDIT] as of the NEXT update i actually would change from bad to good. this is what the game should have been on release. my biggest issue is the price, still over priced, but much bigger improvement to what it was.", "upvoted": true, "time_of_review_unix": 1532995204, "upvotes_window": 7031, "total_window": 8111, "percent_window": 0.8668474910615214, "neu_sent": 0.819, "neg_sent": 0.05, "pos_sent": 0.132, "comp_sent": 0.5719, "neu_window": 0.7027938856015801, "neg_window": 0.0625320512820509, "pos_window": 0.23134874260355057, "comp_window": 0.4774821005917131, "percent_window_roc": 0.9256593734232375, "neu_window_roc": 0.9438620740095875, "neg_window_roc": 0.318559399180701, "pos_window_roc": 0.7999260355029586, "comp_window_roc": 0.8320867344585869, "1day_forecast": -0.0032321955806406955, "1day_delta": -0.0023697114890145476, "pos_predict": 0.015273649783209076, "neg_predict": 0.004651921460358587}, {"time_of_review": "2018-08-01T00:02:39", "review": "Loading up the game and thought this is taking forever. Found out the game never stopped loading, restart i guess. Got into the game, went into the setting and set my graphics to low so i can get the most fps. Set it all and clicked apply. Nothing happned. Checked back its default again. Did it again, still didnt work, getting confused and annoyed. Oh wait you have to hold click... why? I heard you could go into first person. Spent more than 5 min to figure it out. Couldnt find it, searched online and apparently you have to press a key in game to bring up a ui and scroll through a million things to do so... why? Great start so far.\n\nSpawned on a toxic planet couldnt find sodium in the first 20 min to keep me alive from the rads. Finally finds sodium and barely keeps me alive. Found these annoying robots that fire at you when your trying to get resources and tried to get away from them but they are everywhere, yeah noice. Finally repaired my ship apart from one part which i need a upgraded mining tool to mine out the pure ore. Oh my life support systems is going down and taking damage not knowing what is killing me for a while. Figured out it was the air capacity (wasnt very obvious). Couldnt find oxygen to replenish my life support and died continuously. Got my stuff and was roaming around for ages getting bored very easily trying to find this upgrade. Didnt get to find it and died again. Got very frustrated and eventually i gave up because im not gonna run 7 min way to get my stuff back.\n\nMy first impressions of the game is not appealing for me at all unless im doing something wrong (most likely) but it doesnt seem very obvious if i am. Played the game when it first came out and didnt find it that annoying. Fps was surprisingly bad, got a i5 4590 and a GTX 1080 that can run RUST a 80-100 fps but in this game i only got 30-60 on low settings. There should be a tutorial at the start like a proper tutorial. There was a task thing at the bottom right of the screen to build certain parts and what not but it barely told me where to go. I could look up online and learn the game from there but I shouldnt have to look up stuff at the start, I want to enjoy the game myself straight off the bat.

system and the host isnt in that type of system but thats not stoping you from leaving the host behind).  the only downside to me so far is that you both have to do everything in the mission if you

We lauded the ambition and oreviously unheard of scop that the game would present, and patiently awaited the day of its release.\nFinally, that day arrived. I was just moments away from making the purchase, when Nathen - one of my aforementioned friends called - \"Don't do it. The game is DOA.\"\nSo I waited, and watched as slowly, the contempt and hatred of this game built and built, and died off, quietly, and everyone went back to their lives as they were before The Great Disappointment.\nFast forward two more years - another friend of mine - Ben and I got together and had a few beers and he showed this game, as it is now. A new game - a phoenix, risen from the ashes - and as soon as I got home, I bought it, and was instantly immersed.\nAnd I died. A lot. But slowly, and surely, I made progress. I left the barren, burning wasteland upon which I was stranded, and immediately decided it would be a great idea to go and get stranded on a barren, frozen planet, And so on, and so forth. I built my first base, then left for more adventure adn realize I'll probably never go back to it again. I accidentally traded the wrong startship and had tyo pay quadruple it's original value to get it back. I played after work every day, several hours a day, for two weeks until... well, I lost interest, to be frank.\nDon't get me wrong - the game is there. There is a story. There are other players to connect with, and innumerable world to explore...\n...but it all still felt, well, [i] dead [/i]. The magic of the newly polished game subsided, and I was left floating through lightyears of procedurally generated space, with nothing to do.  It's beautiful, but that's about all it is. A hollow, soulless beauty that attracts, but offers little in return for your investment.\nI'll say this much more: \nThis game is for someone. Someone will play this game and [i] love [/i] it, and see past its emptiness, and maybe even see something more than I can. But it's not for me.

We had anticipated this game however at launch based on feedback from those we know and reviews we did not purchase it. We did follow the progress of updates to the game. It is now the game it was advertised to be at its inception. I purchased copies for myself and my two sons.\n\nThis game is not for everyone, it is an open world space exploration game with a plethora of other features, so if that is to your liking then you will appreciate this game. There are a number of other space simulation games out there, I have a number of them, but they do not compare to what No Man's Sky has become.\n\nWhy do we like this game?\n\nFirst the game is well balanced. It has a space combat capabilities but it is not the games primary focus. This is something I respect about the game. There are plenty of good space combat simulators (although I wish we could get a modernized Freespace, but I digress...) and I am glad that this is not the focus of No Man's Sky. You can collect bounties, eliminate pirates, or raid freighters for resources. There is a also a well balanced element of space craft missions. For example you can acquire freighters and frigates to complete space based objectives. I personally would like to see this aspect expanded. It would be cool to be able to travel with a group of craft on assigned missions, to leave and join the convoy at will. All you really can do is send them in groups on missions and wait for them to return. There also is a space station in every star system, which is a very smart choice on the part of the devs for obvious reasons. We also can greatly appreciate being able to use the teleporter to travel cost free between previously explored star systems via space stations.\n\nSpace flight controls are arcade style. You have several engine types depending on whether you need interstellar travel, travel within a solar system, or in a planets atmosphere. This is well developed and balanced, not being cumersome at all, except perhaps that you can not hover (you are always in motion when not in space) and your craft can not perform strafing motions.\n\nThe game focuses on exploration. The universe is truly yours to explore as one could never visit every star system in the game's universe. In addition to exploring and travelling between star systems one can also explore the surface of the planets in each star system. Planets have unique flora and fauna. There are incentives to 'scan' and archive these aspects of each planet giving detailed information. \n\nThe game also has a construction element where you can build bases on planets of your choosing. This aspect is well developed and functional. We have found a few glitches but nothing we have not been able to work around so far. This leads us to one of the primary goals of the game...grinding...\n\nIn my opinion grinding is of aspect of a game that requires very careful consideration and design, such that it is challening enough to the player to not become bored but not difficult enough that one loses interest or becomes frustrated. At the current moment the balance in the game is very good. There are a couple of modes to adjust the difficulty of the game and the grind. As for myself and most people I know, we really want to focus on exploration and do not want to grind excessively having families, jobs, etc. One must grind to provide raw resources to produce finished products via blue prints to build fuel, structures, and basically anything that you need in the game. Once again this portion of the game is well balanced and I would caution the devs be very careful making changes.\n\nThe game also has a functional economy that works well in my opinion. You can buy and sell goods in the markets, purchase upgrades and blue prints. There are a few forms of 'currency', although each type has a different purpose.\n\nThere are three primary civilizations in the game. Diplomacy (although not directly called as such in the game) is an important factor in the game. You can improve or ruin relations in the game by performing missions for a given civilization or raiding their freighters. This is a fairly well developed part of the game as well.\n\nOne thing that really surprised me is the story lines. The primary story lines in my opinion are amazing. They are amazing because they are genuinely unique and well thought out. In addition it has taken me quite some time to get through the missions that I have and I still have not completed all of them or even most of them. Each stage of the story lines does not take to long, which is a good thing because you feel like you are making progress, but rather the stories have depth and a very large numbers of stages. It is not unusal to have 3 to 7 simulateous missions. I think it is very cool that at the end of the primary story line you can basically start over and because of the open world and breadth of the game it is very replayable. \n\nIf you like space and a lot of freedom to explore, and enjoy both being in space as well as on the planets surface, construction, with grinding not being to intolerable, etc. get this game. If you want a space combat simulator do not bother getting this game (you can not do the equivalent of strafing in a space craft, and many other maneuvers that are standard in space simulators, the HUD is under developed, etc.)\n\nThe game crashes on occasion, currently we have no idea why as it happends to all of us, but it is infrequent, and the most recent update seemed to alleviate this issue to some degree.\n\nHere is what we want:\n\n1) The ability to add content to the game.\n\n2) The ability to host our own servers. As multiplayer is currently set up in the game you can find players on your own lan or join some random server on the internet. There are NO provisions to query who is on your game, kick or ban, etc. If you really want this game to thrive we need the ability to host private and public servers our selves WITHOUT needing the run the game, that is, stand alone servers.\n\n3) We want to be able to hover, strafe, and rotate (yaw) spacecraft. A more realistic and functional HUD would be nice. There is a bug in the game where the position of the HUD/cockpit overlay is misplaced and that is really really annoying.\n\n4) We do not want the difficulty of normal mode or grinding in normal mode to change.\n\n5) We want the base computer to be able to be placed in a structure.\n\nTo the devs:\n\nWell done! and do not screw up the game by making major changes to the well balanced systems as they currently exist.\n\nOne last thing: the graphics are beautiful especially considering the kind of dynamics and complexities the game has such a deformable terrain/meshes.

Shortly after buying the game on sale, I managed to play it for 26 hours during two days.\nThat's what a fantastic game and some spare time will do to you.\n\nI know NMS had lots of negative feedback in 2016. People and friends were highly dissapointed, getting promises Hello Games couldn't keep. So I didn't buy it back then. I saw some let's plays and streams from the game at that time, and I felt for the gamers who eagerly bought it only to be met with a simplified, glorified and colorful Elite: Dangerous clone. Only difference being that you can walk out of the ship and run around in first person.\n\nI don't know if a seemingly honest person like Sean Murray actually lied, or if it was true what he said in 2016, just that, in excitement, he forgot to mention his \"lies\"  was actually future plans for the game. Some say Sony forced Hello Games to publish NMS too early, or that Hello Games did it themselves. I don't know. But Sean's answers in the \"70 Rapid-Fire Questions\" video actually holds true for me so far. I've only played solo up until now, and I don't know what the chance is, but another player happened to spawn into the same world I'd been playing on for a good while. On the same spawn point as well, but one spawn point is probably common in every system anyway. Even questions Sean said no to in that video can now be reverted. From video: \"Can you terraform a planet?\" \"Let's say no.\" Well, actually, now you can. Same with character customization, which you will find a contraption for in space stations. It's not the most extensive customization system, but it's bizarre, funky and pretty good in my opinion.\n\nWhen it comes to crafting and recharging different gadgets and life systems, it's a bit unconventional. Something tells me this game was primarily made for PS4, and it wouldn't be that convoluted with a controller. With that said, the game works very well on PC otherwise, and you can always remap the key bindings if you're not happy with the default ones. The layout of the tutorial was a bit confusing at first and the hud was also something to get used to compared to GUI/HUD I'm used to in other games. But I figured it out, no problem.\n\nI'm very happy with the game. I could give it a score, but since the game is as extensive as it is, I don't think I should before I'm absolutely sure. I don't know if you're reading this review because you're thinking about getting back to the game after refunding it way back when, or if you're actually new to the game. Let me reassure you that you won't be dissapointed anymore, unless you figure the game is not your cup of tea. So let me be more spesific:\nIf you like Elite: Dangerous, Spore, crafting and endless exploration, get it.\nSeriously. I absolutely recommend it.\n\nEDIT:\n\nSo after playing it for a longer while, I can say there are some annoying bugs that damages the experience for me just a little bit. Like a certain \"depot\" quest given by my weapons specialist or whatever. Until a fix is found, I'm just gonna explore the other aspects of the game, because regardless of what the negative reviews say, there's so much else to do and so many other ways to get the items you require. So I'm not gonna complain too much about it. The GUI for building bases and such could definitely be more conventional. For now, I'll have to use VoiceAttack for building, so that I don't have to browse through the convoluted building menu every time. Hello Games should implement a separate straightforward fullscreen GUI that could be accessed through a hotkey. Both for PC- and PS4-users, where everything is openly selectable from the get-go. Seriously, Hello Games. Just make it so. And fix your bugs please.\n\nThe game isn't terribly well optimized either. I run 16gb DDR4, 1050 Ti and Intel Core i5-6600K 3.5ghz, oc'd to 4ghz. I find that I have to use the motion blur to compensate for the low fps, which is okay and gives it this \"cinematic look\" so to speak. But judging by the simpler textures, it shouldn't be too hard to optimize the game honestly. I'd hate to lower the settings for at least a constant 60fps gameplay, since the graphics in general are so beautiful to look at. Could be that I'm using two monitors though, but I don't know.\n\nDespite these annoyances, I'm still enjoying the game for all the other amazing features. You can practically do whatever you want. But it has some areas of realism not all people will like. You start up with basically only you and your ship, and you might get a tough start, depending on the circumstances. I did. But don't give up, and you'll find that the game is only tough in the beginning. At least in normal difficulty. You'll get through it, and you'll find it pretty rewarding throughout the game. Especially if you're the explorer type.\n\nTime to give the score I think the game deserves for now. Score may change after game fixes and updates.

Every single planet you visit is basically the same thing. They look different, but the core mechanic is the same. There is always some kind of storm every 5 minutes or so. ( I might be exagerating but it seems to follow a pattern ). You cant just enjoy a planet that doesnt have any major storm. \n\nThat, for me, is the biggest flaw there is, because Im always rushed to do something before the storms comes in.  And the storms affects the WHOLE PLANET, not just parts of it.  \n\nThere is also those robots on every single planet that will chase you. Its literally impossible to just enjoy your stay on a planet. You cant just walk around and enjoy the beautiful scenery for however long you want.  No, you need to hide from robots constantly, or to get ready for the next storm. \n\nMaybe it changes later in the game, I havent played much, but I havent played much for these reasons. It just puts me off. \nAlso its a constant grind, wich I personally find annoying. \"Go there, collect this, build that\" resumes the game pretty good. \nI knew it was a lot of that before I bought the game, but its a bit much for me, I found out. \n\nThe planets are good looking,  but there is something missing to it, it seems there is only one ecosystem per planet. If you land on a planet, and walk 1 minute, youv seen it all. No need to travel on the other side of the planet, it will be the same thing. \n\nThe planet I enjoyed the most are the tropicals one, since there is land and ocean, wich makes it looks nice. I wish the game would create more scenery. Canyons ? Waterfall ? Dense Jungles ? \n\nBut like I said, I havent played much, maybe I simply didnt see those planets. Maybe I dont know how to get robots to stop attacking me. Maybe I dont have the upgrades I need to stay out during storms.  The 11 hours or so I put in this game were boring. I tried to push further to see if there was more to it, but it doesnt look like it. \n\nTraveling trough space is boring. And not the good kind of space travel boring. I find myself lost a lot, trying to find ships or  hangars or whatever. I have played my fair share of Space game, for exemple, Elite Dangerous. Now in Elite dangerous, navigation is great because it feels more real and I can turn my head around. Traveling in space is boring but it looks real so its the good kind of boring. Space is beautiful. I enjoy roaming in space in Elite Dangerous. Its very dark, lots of stars, etc etc. \n\nBut in this game, Space looks like if you were traveling trough the Super Computer and you are role playing Bob, Dot or Enzo.  It feels empty, and not the good kind of empty like Space would be. Space looks pale blue, I havent found anything of notes in space. I just remember it being pale blue.  \n\nSo these are my problems with this game. Maybe if the gameplay was not centered around mining and grinding, it could have been a fun. Maybe if there was more to the game, such as planets that have life on it. There is many races in the game but seems that no one is living on any planet. No urban centers, just trade post. No barbaric tribes, no signs of intelligent life anywhere but with the space travelers.  It just feels so empty, I feel Im the only one living in this world.  I wish this game was a cross of GTA and Kingdom Come:Deliverance,  but in space. But its not. \n\nAnyway, I applaud the devs for sticking to the game even after complete failure. I wanted to try this game for a long time and after the NEXT update, I decided to jump on it.  I dont think I will ever like this game but we will see what the future holds. \n\nI cannot recommend the game as I think it is a boring one. I cant think of a lot of people who likes to grind in an empty world and this is the impression I have about the game. \n\n", "upvoted": false, "time_of_review_unix": 1537336344, "upvotes_window": 168, "total_window": 252, "percent_window": 0.6666666666666666, "neu_sent": 0.734, "neg_sent": 0.137, "pos_sent": 0.129, "comp_sent": 0.5677, "neu_window": 0.7087470355731229, "neg_window": 0.09074308300395259, "pos_window": 0.19255335968379453, "comp_window": 0.4516802371541502, "percent_window_roc": 0.7261329166283665, "neu_window_roc": 0.9533409004344363, "neg_window_roc": 0.38127090301003347, "pos_window_roc": 0.691699604743083, "comp_window_roc": 0.7711206528848068, "1day_forecast": -0.0029112081513827937, "1day_delta": -0.024783147459727428, "pos_predict": 0.10894656378621019, "neg_predict": 0.2049517006983047}, {"time_of_review": "2018-09-20T00:38:38", "review": "Before you read my review, a few things: I bought this game on sale ($20 I believe), and I bought this game after all the splendid updates that improved it from the launch disaster. \n\nThat being said, I had a wonderful time playing this, as you can tell by the nearly 200 hours put into it. If you want a deep, rich story, or an action packed pace with a diversity of challenges and missions, this game will dissappoint you. I however just wanted something I could come home from work and relax to. Something I could pick up and have fun with and not add to the stress of the day. No Mans Sky was exactly that! Fun exploration, pretty darn good base and farming mechanics. Ship and freighter costs that teeter toward the edge of a grind, but are really just rewarding in nature. It has a slow start, but once you expand your crafting and purchasing power it becomes quite fun. And the fauna.. well they can be quite odd which is funny, and each planet has its own oddities.

Are you going to go out and do something new, or do you want to be spoon fed your entertainment? The limits here are only your ability to think outside the box. How creative are you really? Do you find something to do when others keep saying there's nothing to do? Are you always coming up with new ways to entertain yourself? Do you fill your time every day, or do you spend a lot of time wondering what to do next? If you have what it takes, No Man's Sky can back you up. If you don't have what it takes, this isn't what you're looking for. It says it's no man's sky... Make it yours. Explore, discover, craft, build, fight, learn, grow.\n\n\n\nEdit: NEXT Update\nReturning to the game after NEXT is like visiting an old friend that got a whole hell of a lot cooler since you last met. The characters have better animations, body language, etc. The mode select is still there, but it works better now, which is fabulous. I've only had a few glitches, but they resovled themselves with a save and restart. Once I was attacked by pirates and my freighter locked me out even after my fleet won the battle. Just flew to the space station and saved/restarted and my freighter went back to normal. The game is still hard to run, but it runs better than before. I have only encountered a few spots that are unplayable on my 6th gen i5/GTX 1060 6GB/8GB RAM setup. At those places I found that slowing down relieved the issue and caused the game to run again. I'll have to run it on the minimum settings on my 2560x1080 screen, but at lower resolutions it should be much smoother. Minimum requirements do not seem accurate at all, not even in the slightest. Be warned. This game takes one hell of a PC to run perfectly.\n\n\n\nEdit: Pathfinder Update!\nThe new update(s) have reignited my joy in playing No Man's Sky. The universe they have created seems to be ever expanding and growing. Keep up the updates Hello Games! Every one has been wonderful. The game has gone from a 60 hour grinding heavy game to a 200+ hour game where you can play your own style and difficulty. The difference from launch date is stupendous. Looking forward to more!\n\n\nOld review:\nSo NMS is great and all, but until DLC comes out it's more of a 20-60 hour game than a limitless adventure. Yes, I personally will enjoy it for MUCH longer than 60 hours. But most people will be done and over it in 20-60.\n\nIt's tough, yes. But anyone who plays well can get through the \"main story\" in about 20 hours or less with 0 deaths if they really go for it. You can reach the core at the 20-50+ hour mark depending on whether you're rushing through it or just messing around.\n\nAnd the pre-order ship is absolute garbage that I never even redeemed. I thought it would be more helpful than it really was, so by the time I felt ready for a new ship I already had something better than a Horizon Omega. I figure I'll just save the pre-order ship until I finally decide to restart the game from scratch, at which point it will be only slightly helpful instead of completely useless.\n\nAll in all. I love it, but it's not for everyone.\n60$? For me, worth it. For someone who is not interested in it, not worth it.\nYou have to go into the game without hard expectations in order to enjoy it.\nI enjoy games for what they are, not what I think they should be.\nIf you have that mentality, this game is absolutely amazing.\n\n\nEdit:\nPS: The intro screen is long and drawn out, and I can't skip it for some reason. And the achievements trigger something similar to a cut scene that doesn't pause the game. Those are my criticisms, because they get in the way of the actual gameplay. Although they really aren't that bad.\n\nEdit 10/17/16:\n130 hours in. Tested/used most of the mods I could find. Played through everything. Made every decision multiple times. The game runs out of gameplay after a while. I got my 60$ worth. Although I checked in a local store the other day and they actually dropped the price significantly. If you want to play this, and in-store pickup might save you 10-30$ depending on your local prices. I don;t know about PS4--vs-PC copies though. I use both, and the PS4 copy is way cheaper now.

On top of it all, since NEXT was aout adding multiplayer....I still can't enter multiplayer as the game has a bug recognizing my save file! No Multiplayer, Still!\n\nAs I'm a little ways into the game in terms of hours, the biggest challenge now is , for example, to figure out what ferrite is, what it used to be, what it looks like (who knows?), and what a refiner is, etc. This is all after tens of hours of gameplay, and familiarity with NMS. The developers may not have realized how difficult a shift this would be for long-time gamers of NMS, and did not prepare tutorials in-game to deal with this crazy transition. \n\n- Can't fill launch thruster to go off planet until I figure out what newly named elements I need to refine - effectively stranding me, no tutorial or indication of where to find it/what to do\n- Can't fly to different star systems due to no transitional guides (no elements, no familiarity with where to acquire them)--leaves player stranded\n- Removal of all upgrades that were hard-earned--leaves the player to start from scratch, and what a pain that is! What did we do to deserve this, forty plus hours into the game?\n- Destruction of base -- again, stranding me in my game progression, dozens of hours invested lost.\n\nI'm not sure why it wasn't clear in the first place that such immense changes (haphazard) would lead to an outcry of frustration, but I'm sure the complaints about this are rolling in: the game was largely playable and fun before NEXT. Now I kind of wish I could go back to previous version of NMS so I can pretend NEXT didn't happen.

I have always had a soft spot for space exploration / trading / combat games - Elite on DOS was one of the first games I ever played on PC - and No Man's Sky, despite it's very rough launch (and overblown promises) has been on my radar. My intrigue piqued with the NEXT update and I decide to jump in with both feet only to find myself falling into a pit of quicksand.\n\nThe game is beautiful and no doubt countless screenshots from the developers and community are great at evoking the wonder and sense of scale that NMS gives you very early on. But then as you play the curtain is slowly pulled back to reveal a very shallow and unsatisfying gaming experience.\n\nFirstly let me just say of all the open world, survival games on the market that I've played, NMS has got to have one of the WORST introductions of any game in its class. Unlike Minecraft or 7 Days to Die (or many others), where you are dropped in a relatively safe area and encouraged to collect resources in order to craft the necessary tools to open up the rest of the game to you, NMS literally throws you to the wolves. You're dropped on an environmentally hostile planet with limited oxygen and life support which need O2 and sodium to recharge, you also need basic metal to repair your tools and your ship (until then you're essentially grounded), which you're told to mine with your mining laser. \n\nOh okay, simple enough. Except if you mine for more than 30 seconds, uh oh, here comes an insidious sentinel robot (which inhabit every planet you're on), which almost immediately begins to attack you if you mine too much. Naturally your first instinct is to fight back, doing so will reward you with two more robots bearing down on your position. Fighting them unleashes another wave of robots this time three and so forth. So basically the lesson to be gleamed from all this is: don't fucking fight. Run.\n\nSo you run. And you run. and you run (\u266b\u266aso far away\u266a\u266b). and then you hide and then you mine and then you run some more until you've fixed your ship. But your running isn't over yet because then you're treated with a never-ending breadcrumb trail of quests and hints on unveiling the inner mysteries of the game, something to do with ancient aliens called Anomaly (or something like that) and getting to the galactic center.\n\nSo you travel from one planet to another, you upgrade your ship, you engage in some space combat but after a dozen hours or more it all starts to feel the same. Almost every planet is inhabited by procedurally generated animals (along with aforementioned sentinels). Space is peppered with conveniently (if unrealistically) placed asteroid fields which you will eventually mine, but the mining isn't for making money not really, it's just another means for producing things for the carrot-on-the-stick you're chasing.\n\nThis grind - and yes NMS is extremely grindy for what is essentially a single-player game - wouldn't be so bad if the other aspects of the game were at least interesting. But trading in the game is relatively pointless. Mining is an extremely tedious test of your patience. Space combat is a joke, as even tough enemies seem to just seem to flight in tight circles while taking grazing shots at you. Character interaction is almost nil in the early-to-mid game because you have to learn each alien species' language, so any exchanges with them are purely guessing games of \"pick the right response.\" \n\nAnd for a space game NMS has one of the worst navigational systems I've ever seen in the genre, as it is almost non-existent; the system that is there becomes awash in numerous, sometimes dozens, of floating markers that you need to somehow hover over and tag and fly toward. The Discovery tab they have for naming/uploading systems to the discovery service is useless for navigation. So if you want to see how many planets are in a particular system their names and what is on those planets -- well good luck with that buddy -- because you literally have to spin in space and look at each planet manually and then fly there.\n\nUltimately NMS' gameplay loop of mine/crafting/exploration is fundamentally flawed. Dozens of hours in other open world / survival / crafting games makes you feel like you've accomplished something; you might have a fort or home to be proud of, perhaps a working resource farm of some sort, you have amassed some nice weapons that help you fight off enemies.\n\nI get none of this from NMS. I have 20-30 hours in the game now and I feel like I'm still chasing the next clue while wandering through another random system whose importance is meaningless in the vast sea of stars that make up NMS' galaxy. Part of me just wants to uninstall now and hope a future update fixes this. Part of me wants to go back to see if I can finally unlock one piece of the puzzle but the interminable grinding makes it feel more like a chore than an adventure.\n\n5/10 -- wait for a sale if you really must play No Man's Sky but otherwise skip it until the developers fix its fundamental flaws.", "upvoted": false, "time_of_review_unix": 1538352541, "upvotes_window": 141, "total_window": 220, "percent_window": 0.6409090909090909, "neu_sent": 0.836, "neg_sent": 0.075, "pos_sent": 0.089, "comp_sent": 0.925, "neu_window": 0.7325791855203625, "neg_window": 0.08431674208144796, "pos_window": 0.1785701357466063, "comp_window": 0.3678375565610857, "percent_window_roc": 0.6736188572029884, "neu_window_roc": 0.9519269458561148, "neg_window_roc": 0.4594500522102332, "pos_window_roc": 0.6334841628959276, "comp_window_roc": 0.6778459585272958, "1day_forecast": -0.004545454545454519, "1day_delta": -0.001948051948052032, "pos_predict": 0.09038444818387792, "neg_predict": 0.026479358556007544}, {"time_of_review": "2018-10-02T07:13:23", "review": "The game has no options menu, and loading up the game took 15 minutes.

I wouldnt care about the quest lines so much if exploration was better but it is not, it is the same, same planet, same animals, same rocks, and same plants. For the big kicker, if you find something you like about the game dont worry they will change it so you dont like it. The vehicle selection is also trash. There would be no complaints from me if there was one or the other, good quest or good exploration.

If you think that No Man's Sky, is going to be this incredible experience, with ever different worlds, and new excitement at every turn, you are an idiot.\n\nLet's get this straight, this is a procedurally generated game (read:  not infinitely different, but infinite variations of the same stuff over and over again)--it is also a survival, open-world, exploration, crafting game.  The game is a couple of gigabytes in size.  So, if you really think that this game is going to offer endless entertainment, joy, and excitement, just stop jumping on hype bandwagon's so much and you'll settle into your meger existance just fine.\n\nSo the game.\n\nYes, it gets repetative.  Honestly, did you think it wasn't going to be?  You have a mission--get to the center of the Universe.  And while maybe you'll want to go and explore your world, and learn about all these new creatures and aliens you encounter, the point of the game is to eventually make it to the center at some point.  So, yes, the game consists of you doing the same boring stuff you'd do in any similar game (read: Minecraft, Don't Starve Together).  You need to farm materials, to craft items, to power your ship (or get a new one, or upgrade stuff you have), so that you may move onto the next system and do it all over again.\n\nI know, boring, isn't it?\n\nWell, if you were expecting more, I said up above that you are an idiot, or maybe you were hoping it would be something more than it is, but still, you are an idiot if you think it was going to be more than that.\n\nThe game, as it stands, has completely lived up to everything I thought and expected it to be.  Is it going to be a game I want to keep playing?  No.  Definitely not.  Do I think it was worth $59.99.  No, no I do not think it was.  Now, I know they factored in all the DLC that they won't be charging for into that price, but hell, my BF, who is in China, got the game for $25, so, as an American, I do feel slightly ripped off that I paid a lot more than other people in the world.  But...  listen, day one, I put in around 12 hours.  So, it was at least entertaining enough that I played it that long.  However, here I am, writing this review, that might never be read by anyone, and I have to tell you, that frankly, while I want to hit PLAY, I'm kinda like, meh....  I could go play something else where character progression means something.  \n\nSo, I do recommend the game.  But, honestly, don't spend $59.99.  Wait, it will drop, probably 50% off by the Steam Winter Sale, and if it isn't 50% off by then, it will be by Spring.\n\nIt's well done, but it needs a lot more to make this something people want to keep coming back to again and again.\n\n$0.02\n\nEdit:  No real update, just have to update something for Steam awards.  :p", "upvoted": true, "time_of_review_unix": 1542931298, "upvotes_window": 1395, "total_window": 1483, "percent_window": 0.9406608226567768, "neu_sent": 0.775, "neg_sent": 0.075, "pos_sent": 0.15, "comp_sent": 0.9913, "neu_window": 0.6864757412398916, "neg_window": 0.04991509433962269, "pos_window": 0.2615828840970348, "comp_window": 0.5826068733153643, "percent_window_roc": 0.9284617313357989, "neu_window_roc": 0.9291326370035933, "neg_window_roc": 0.3044785403275969, "pos_window_roc": 0.8419811320754718, "comp_window_roc": 0.9096883544377435, "1day_forecast": 0.0034509537903290033, "1day_delta": 0.05075256577604281, "pos_predict": 0.14591356906993852, "neg_predict": 0.005571646007406024}, {"time_of_review": "2018-11-24T00:00:06", "review": "I would like yo retract this review.

But instead what they are providing is a constant stream of practical, asthetic, and performance upgrades that is mind-blowing.

For the record I didn't know much about the No Man's Sky (NMS) until very recently. (Late November 2018). I heard about its release and the widespread disappointment people felt. That, and owning Elite Dangerous, (ED), kept me away.\n\nReading about the many problems people had with it at release, I suppose I'm lucky I \"waited,\" this long to buy it. Currently at V1.7 it's said to now have more features and story than was ever talked about pre-release. There have been several major updates and ALL have been free. Meaning that, so far, there's been no need to buy DLC content. YEAH!\n\nI have about twenty hours play time so far and I find it to be an amazing game. It's kind of arcadish, compared to ED and its Newtonian Physics. ED is great, especially in VR, but I'm still waiting for it to develop to the point where it's easy to get into it. Comparing what you can do in it vs in NMS... well... there's no comparison.\n\nI've only seen the surface of maybe a half dozen planets but, so far, nearly all have been beautiful and diverse. Colorful too! LOVE the colors. That and the relaxing music make it very enjoyable to just wander around and explore.\n\nI have a few quibbles so far:\n\n- The start is a bit brutal. You \"wake up,\" on a planet with almost no life support left in your suit and no idea how to play; what to do. Even though I've read The Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy I still paniced - and then died. I then loaded a YouTube video that showed what to do in those first few minutes and survived the next start. lol.\n\n- I'd love to see them do away with the fields of asteroids you encounter just outside the atmosphere of, so far, every planet I've visited. I know we need to be able to mine Tritium(?) to power our ship's jumps within a system but geesh, they're everywhere. I find it quite immersion breaking. I'd rather mine the resource on planet and/or in planetary rings and/or an actual asteroid field that orbits the systems star(s).\n\n- There doesn't seem to be a way to bring one's ship to a complete stop. Coming in to land, once you're low enough to do so, you're still moving at a good clip. It's hard, nigh impossible, to make precise touchdowns.\n\n- Lastly I'd love to experience NMS's many worlds in VR. That's coming, sometime, apparently. I just hope I'm still into playing then.\n\nIf you have any doubts watch Twitch feeds and YouTube videos. You'll see that this game brings what we're still waiting for in Elite Dangerous.", "upvoted": true, "time_of_review_unix": 1544746594, "upvotes_window": 358, "total_window": 436, "percent_window": 0.8211009174311926, "neu_sent": 0.777, "neg_sent": 0.083, "pos_sent": 0.14, "comp_sent": 0.9884, "neu_window": 0.698599542334097, "neg_window": 0.06856521739130436, "pos_window": 0.22599542334096115, "comp_window": 0.48525011441647614, "percent_window_roc": 0.9640040444893831, "neu_window_roc": 0.9198903425244561, "neg_window_roc": 0.26720647773279355, "pos_window_roc": 0.8810068649885585, "comp_window_roc": 0.9486813295359137, "1day_forecast": -0.01749370300233488, "1day_delta": -0.002564975840269046, "pos_predict": 0.00696064103553688, "neg_predict": 0.005739563400871973}, {"time_of_review": "2018-12-15T00:14:23", "review": "Since the NEXT update, the game is so very enjoyable.

I guess this review will be quite a retrospective look on the game and, as such, may be quite lengthy. For those who just want the bottom line, there should be a TL;DR at the bottom. If you're still here, let's start.\n\nI originally bought this game back in 2016 the day it came out. I had always been interested in space exploration games such as Elite Dangerous which I love. The promises made by this game made me ecstatic and when it finally released I bought immediately. Needless to say, I was let down. We all remember that E3 demo Sean Murray gave showing off the rich wildlife, beautiful flowers and trees, and the overall lush and vibrant landscape of the worlds in NMS. what I got ? A radioactive shithole barren of any life or color, almost making me feel I was playing a F2P version of Fallout. I exited the game and made a new save, thinking that I couldn\u2019t possibly get a terrible planet again\u2026 boy was I wrong. Instead, I was given a intense heat planet with storms and almost died many times trying to make it to a cave. I was pissed. I immediately got a refund and wrote off the game. \n\nOver the years, I still followed news concerning the game. Saw many terrible and angry reviews touting NMS as one of the worst disappointments in gaming history and painting Sean Murray as some horrible person who tried to make a quick buck. But then something changed, I started seeing \u201cA look back at..\u201d and \u201cA Re-Review of\u2026\u201d videos and saw that much had changed. Peopling were urging others to come back and see the game again. People were praising the devs and admiring their tenacity to fix the game. So, on 12/21/2018, after having finished my exams and in desperate need of something to do, I bought the game on sale for $23.\n\nI spawned on a radioactive planet, but saw it had clouds, trees, and vast open fields. It actually looked like an amazing scene from a Sci-Fi film. I quickly got through the tutorial parts and blasted into space. Planet after planet and system by system my love for the game grew. I played 6 hours in the first day. I explored a wide variety of beautiful planets with amazing scenery and got very connected to the deep storyline the game presents.\n\nIn the 17 hours I have which may not sound like much, I have acquired a cozy little freighter with a few frigates and a decent inventory of ships. I have much to do but wanted to write this review now for those like me who love space exploration but are on the fence for getting this game.\n\nNMS is not a perfect game by any stretch of the imagination. It screams of a terrible console port to pc. You have to restart the whole game for simple changes such as window type, VSYNC, and framerate cap which comes at 30fps for some ridiculous reason. You also need to hold down the mouse for any inventory action which makes sense to account for the inaccuracies of a controller, but not a mouse. Thankfully, many of these are fixed with a few simple mods which I implore you to explore over at the Nexus. There are some great quality of life changes and even some flight mechanics tweaks for the keyboard and mouse user. Whether or not it should be our job as consumers to fix a product is a discussion for another time but I still felt like including this for those who have similar gripes as I. Also, the fact that every station, freighter hangar/bridge, trading outpost and more are the EXACT same seriously angers me. (there is a mod on the nexus to make the bridges on freighters look amazing btw).\n\nIn the end, NMS is a far from perfect game which has come a long way and significantly overhauled almost every aspect of its experiences to make what I consider to be the best space exploration game out there. I\u2019ve put considerable time in Elite Dangerous and even a little of Star Citizen and they pale in comparison to the fun I\u2019ve had with this game. It is most definitely worth a buy if you love space and even more so if you have friends to play with as the multiplayer works quite nicely from what I can tell (not that I\u2019ve tried since my friends are Battle Royale obsessed idiots) and could make for an incredible experience.\n\nTL;DR- NMS is now an amazing game that has fixed many of its core issues, but still leaves some things to be desired. Overall, 8.5/10.\n", "upvoted": true, "time_of_review_unix": 1545697366, "upvotes_window": 460, "total_window": 600, "percent_window": 0.7666666666666667, "neu_sent": 0.785, "neg_sent": 0.068, "pos_sent": 0.147, "comp_sent": 0.9975, "neu_window": 0.6908103161397672, "neg_window": 0.08138269550748749, "pos_window": 0.2211913477537437, "comp_window": 0.44823760399334495, "percent_window_roc": 0.8344619432728397, "neu_window_roc": 0.927502524393821, "neg_window_roc": 0.37168821195443497, "pos_window_roc": 0.7803660565723795, "comp_window_roc": 0.8057404326123128, "1day_forecast": -0.008157752566180454, "1day_delta": -0.00243350311262025, "pos_predict": 0.04084063165939543, "neg_predict": 0.0060462948693475755}, {"time_of_review": "2018-12-26T00:02:57", "review": "Tried to play the game but couldnt pass the tutorial because of a bug.

I have hope that Hello Games will patch some of the missing features into the game, but who knows. I played the game for 45 hours because I never expected them to nail a near 100% procedural game in one try, and fully expected there to be missing features.\n\nInstead I'm going to talk about the easily avoidable poor game design and UI choices that largely contributed to this being an unbearable experience for so many people. These issues make it seem like Hello Games did absolutely nothing to ensure they were using generally good game design practices, and instead only focused on technical aspects of the game. If these things were executed better, the game wouldn't have received such negative feedback, and the sad part is executing these better wasn't a matter of development time, it was a matter of simply making different balancing or UI choices. \n\n[olist]\n [*]You have to click and hold for at least 500 milliseconds and any UI element in the game.\n [*]The UI for the inventory system is clunky. It's an integral part of gameplay, including combat, and yet they still made it slow and difficult to use. There are no shortcuts to open straight to your gun's inventory or your ship's or yours, it just opens to the last one of the 3 that you had open. Then you have to long press with the mouse or press A or D to cycle to the inventory you want. There's an animation when this occurs which further slows things down. Navigating this is required to refuel shields and ammo in combat...\n [*]Refueling things relies on you dragging items around in your inventory and has to occur extremely often.... what kind of game designer would ever think this was a good idea?? Almost ANYTHING would have been better than this. Pressing a key to reload, or even having items automatically feed from specific slots in your inventory would have been better.\n [*]You can never improve the rate at which your modules consume fuel.  There are no efficiency upgrades, so you're stuck harvesting fuel at the same rate in the beginning of the game as you are 60 hours later.\n [*]Sentinels have some simple implementation flaws that make them a nearly worthless addition to the game.  They don't get harder as you get stronger, and even at the very beginning of the game they're not hard. You don't have to run away if a sentinel attacks you, or even two.  As soon as I got a few minor upgrades for my weapon, the sentinels never played a role in my game again except for being harvested for their titanium. On hostile sentinel planets I was never in danger. \n [*]The \"wanted level\" has simple implementation flaws that make it a worthless addition to the game. It doesn't seem to consistently increase when you commit more crimes. I personally never even managed to max it out despite trying, and that's not because I would die, that's because I simply couldn't seem to commit great enough crimes. I would even steal rare items off hostile sentinel planets and slowly kill the sentinels that spawned, giving them time to call for backup. The wanted level at 4 stars is almost no more dangerous than the wanted level at 1 star once you have a few basic gun upgrades. Maintaining a consistent wanted level also doesn't seem to keep a constant flow of sentinels coming. They don't seem capable of repeatedly calling reinforcements. \n [*] Talking to NPCs has slow animations that make it feel extremely tedious to do. It completely goes against the grain of the free play style they tried to implement, and it feels jarring to not be able to be locked in place waiting for UI animations to complete. You should just be able to run away from a conversation without having to press the close button, and it shouldn't take a whole 3 seconds to get to useful interaction.\n [*] Flying your ship low on planets is impossible, yet is important enough that 60 hours later I still find myself trying to do it. Not only is it impossible, but the mechanic they implemented to stop you from flying low also makes controlling your ship harder even if you stay at the altitude they deemed acceptable. \n [*] Pacing of the game is extremely rough. If you're a player who likes to explore planets and find all (or most) of the animals, which you would think is something Hello Games would LOVE for you to do, you're going to be punished by the fact that you'll run out of new RPG content after your first 5 planets, but will still have to visit dozens or hundreds more in order to get to the center of the galaxy. It seems like they only intended for players to shoot straight towards the center/atlas as fast as they possibly could, but did nothing to encourage that play style.  \n [*] The game presents you, albeit in a half-assed manner, with goals such as getting to the center of the universe or completing the Atlas questline, (Spoiler:) [spoiler]but there is no benefit to achieving either of these goals. Your gameplay will not change in a meaningful way, and you will feel cheated. You have to work pretty hard to get to the center, and you also have to make things a lot harder for yourself to hold onto all 10 atlas orbs, but you get nothing for doing either of these things. An example of a better game design choice would have been to grant you the ability to return to any planet you've been to as a reward for completing Atlas, and to allow you to travel freely between galaxies once you've reached the center. Alternatively, they could have given you a special ability to warp back to one system from wherever you are and also return to where you warped from - this would give you a home base of sorts and allow you to collect ships and actually ENJOY the things you've named.[/spoiler]\n [*] Navigation is virtually impossible and the UX of the map is atrocious. You can either randomly wander around with no concept of direction, or you can head towards the center, that is it. You can't revisit cool planets you liked, you can't get a concept of where you are in the galaxy, the map is worthless. Warping might as well just automatically take you to a random planet closer to the center of the galaxy, because that's how useless the navigation system is. Additionally the UX in the map is awful. There's no way to zoom out and get a pretty view of the galaxy with your location marked, it's hard to see the paths the game is recommending, and its even harder to actually utilize those paths. Systems you visited aren't marked, there's no \"show my path\" feature or anything. \n [*] While ships and NPCs are procedurally generated, this seems to be per-system, and there is no real variety unless you continuously move through systems fairly quickly. You find this out if you ever stand in a space station for more than 10 minutes watching the ships come and go. You can literally have 4 identical NPCs in identical ships with identical buying/selling options in station at the same time.  An hour later, these same clones are still coming and going. Each system seems to get maybe 8 randomly rolled ships (and NPC pilots for those ships) that are locked in as long as you stay in that system. This locking of the ships/npcs even includes a locking of what that npc will buy/sell. This was one of the biggest letdowns in the game, and should have been very easy to avoid. They would have been better off with 100% random rolling of ships right before they are spawned than whatever weird system they used. \n [*] Intra-system travel times are pretty bad and can never be improved. I'm fine with the speeds you move at at the beginning of the game, but after upgrading your ship dozens of times you should be able to move faster than a new player while pulse jumping between planets and space stations...\n [*] Trading options at the station do not change as trade ships come and go. The NPCS that land appear to literally just land and then fly away.\n[/olist]", "pos_sent": 0.117, "neg_sent": 0.097, "review_example": "SHIT SHIT SHIT SHIT SHIT", "topics": ["lied", "refund", "advertised"]}, {"time_of_review": "2016-08-27T00:00:19", "percent_window": 0.46194804002570455, "review": "Key Points:\n1. Redefined the term open world\n     I have alwasy had dreams of space travel\n     This game allows me to experience the dream\n     game I have always wanted to play but never\n     was able to because no other company realized\n     how brilliant this concept is\n2. Terrifyingly Beautiful\n     For those players who enjoy calm games like\n     Shadow of the Colossus and some of the early\n     Final Fantasy games this is a good buy.\n     Athmospheric and immersive. Not something I \n     can play for more than 2 hours at a time.\n     But when I need to relax I start up \n     this game.\n3. Big price tag. Small company\n     The game is expensive. About the same price\n     GTA V was on release. And in my opinion,\n     while I recommend this game to everyone,\n     you can get an almost equal experience with\n     stopping by your local second hand game store\n     and picking up an old ps2 or xbox. The company\n     is really cool though. So if you can afford it,\n     get it. Don't skip buying food for this super\n     overhyped game that had horrible misrepresentation\n     on mainstream media and leave bad reviews because\n     you didn't do any research.\n4. Everything is randomized... almost\n     I'm pretty sure everything is randomized except\n     for alien civilizations and the main platform for\n     landing in space stations. Just a heads up for \n     anyone who cares about that sort of thing.\n     (music is very cool.... and it is also randomized)\n5. Monotonous\n     At times this game can be monotonous. But for\n     me it did not effect my high appreciation for\n     what it is. A survival game. Minecraft was \n     monotonous for me at times. The game needs\n     base building to make the monotony worth \n     doing. But Hello Games said they might be\n     making add on content with this feature.\n     So fear not!!\n6. Mods are happening\n     I noticed a few mods are popping up on the\n     internet. Whether you want the ability to \n     play user created content or the possibility\n     of other players being able to cheat, that\n     is on you as a buyer to decide. I think it's\n     fine as this at the moment is a single player\n     game. Hello Games has been on top of sensoring\n     offensive planet names. So I imagine if modding\n     interferes with the gameplay of others vanilla\n     games they company will do something about it.\n     Too early to say now though.\n7. Weak storyline, but open to interpretation\n     Hello games did an excellent job at leaving it's\n     story content open ended for the user to fill in\n     their own blanks. For those of you who have no\n     imagination this game might be difficult for you.\n     A game for the young at heart. And also for geeks.\n     I am a geek. <3 Science!\n8. Too unusual to fit into a genre\n     No Man's Sky is one of the most ususual games\n     I've ever played. It does not have the perks \n     the pokemon and mario games had with piggybacking\n     off original firsties. It is the first game of\n     its' kind. And that is why I believe that there\n     are so many mixed reviews. Not because the devs\n     lied or the game sucks. But because it's\n     un-placeable in the video game industry.\n     It transcends what we precieve video games to be.\n     I support Hello Games because they had the\n     guts to invest in something that was new and\n     possibly a bit scary for everyone involved.\n\n\nI give this game the following ratings out of 10\n\n\nBeauty/Athmosphere               10\n\nControls (keyboard)              10\n\nControls (360 controller)        4\n\nDifficulty                       Mixed\n\nStory                            Mixed\n\nMusic                            10\n\nReplayability                    7\n\nGame Stability as of\n 8/25/16                         6\n(on expirimental build)\n\nCan my mom play it?              3\n\nReward for work done in-game     3\n\nCustomization of content         2\n(without mods installed)\n\nSuspence                         8\n\nQuality of procedural \ngeneration                       10\n(planets, species, ships ect..)\n\nRealism of survival mechanics    6\n\nEase of managing gamesaves       0!\n\n\n\n\nVerdict:\n     If you've read this far chances are you\n     will be as much in love with this \n     terrifying beast of a game as I am.\n\n", "pos_sent": 0.173, "neg_sent": 0.087, "review_example": "Terrible lies", "topics": ["lied", "refund", "advertised"]}, {"time_of_review": "2016-08-28T00:00:20", "percent_window": 0.3620844027935295, "review": "1.

The marketting leading up to this game's release was unrepresentative, as are some of the Steam Store screenshots and videos. My review will instead intent to focus on the game without consideration of the events leading up to its release.\n\n\nThis is ultimately a huge space exploration game. All planets and animals are procedurally generated, meaning theoretically no two are identical and there are billions upon billions of planets to explore and animals to find. Any planet or animal you find first you get the option to name it and upload your finding, meaning any other player who comes across it will see your chosen name(s). This is unfortunately the extent of the positives.\n\nThe game has a massive, practically endless explorable environment, however once you've visited two star systems you will have seen most of the constituent parts that exist- meaning any new planet will just be the same parts in different configurations, and any new animals will be the same legs you've already seen, on another body you've already seen, etc.\n\nFor even less variety you only have to look as far as space stations. They all have identical interiors. And the space ships- they all handle the same, and their technologies don't differ by ship- only by the blueprints you know and materials you have to hand. The only differences between ships are aesthetics and inventory slots.\n\nThat brings me nicely onto inventory- for an exploration game the inventory is TINY. You get barely enough space to store the parts required to craft many things. And with the limited life support duration and running speed you are not encouraged to venture far from your ship. Combine that with the heavy materials cost to simply take off it very quickly becomes a grind.\n\nFinanlly the actual flight- the main reason many are even looking at this game. It's... so so. Once you get into a planet's atmosphere you are restricted from flying too low by an invisible barrier. The landing and taking off are both automatic one-button actions.\n\nTo conclude this is a fun little experience for a few hours, but after that it quickly becomes a grind with little-to-no payoff (as there is no story or direction). At the current \u00a340 price point is it NOT worth it. If you get the chance to grab it for \u00a320 or under I'd recommend it. I think the best thing about it I heard recently was that it's as vast as an ocean but deep as a puddle.

Well, yes, if you're in the first category above, but it's definitely not if you're in the second.\n\nI'm 41 and I've been gaming since I was 13, and very little truly amazes me these days, but No Man's Sky has, the scale of vision for the developers is immense.  One example that springs to mind is, leave a massive space station, fly down to the surface of a planet and then look back and see that same space station hanging in the sky over the planet, stunning.

Wanna be a pirate and steal resources from freighters?? then do that how about an explorer getting paid to discover new plants and animals species?.....\n\nBase building is basic and quite limited but its fine, unless you like building epic structures out of cubes of course.  \n\nPersonally i think this game has dared to be different and in many ways it succeeds, sure, improvements can be made but its going in the right direction and the Devs clearly care about the game and have not abandoned the community.\n\nSo its a thumbs up from me, i am absolutely  loving this game.", "pos_sent": 0.199, "neg_sent": 0.066, "review_example": "If you like exploring, just hitting the road, finding your own path then this game is for you.

More space battles, freighters to purchase, 6 ships can be owned at one time, base building, improved inventory management, land vehicles, weather and atmosphere is a huge factor now rather than an annoyance that every few mins you just recharge hazard protection (caught in a storm? that'll wipe out your protection in under 60 seconds without cover).\n\nA very enjoyable, relaxing game.

I'm still not 100% what this is!?!\nIs it to explore the aliens, in the tedious \"story\" arc? Hmmm, I lost interest in that from the get go!\n\nIs it to mine constantly, so you can buy bigger ships and then mine more, then buy the biggest ships, then mine more, and eventually die of old age? (or more likely, head to a toxic world and take off your helmet!)\nAnd if so, what is the point of getting bigger ships? They don't really do anything. Sure you can dog fight some NPC's that are painfully easy to kill, but what else? The only real benefit of getting better ships is to mine more! Hooray!\n\nMaybe base building is the aim?....no, it can't be! Because bases are FUGLY, simplistic and generally pointless too. even the occupants you can hire, just stand in the corner and do nothing! Even THEY are bored!!!!\n\nMaybe it's to travel to far off worlds and meet strange new civili...NOPE! It's not that either! not when the aliens are all mid-2000 low poly, low texture cartoon characters, who all live in the same few variations of bases and sit in the same places every time.\nOh and the strange new worlds!....The worlds are about as different from each other as Coke is from Pepsi!\nThe \"proceeduraly generated\" animals are also a fail. There are about 20 different variations of life across the entire galaxy apparently! THERE ARE MORE VARIATIONS IN INNER CITIES ON EARTH! I didn't need No Man's Sky. I needed a walk outside!\nA cow-horse with a long neck and purple spots and a cow-horse with a short neck and purple spots, does not make a totally new species, Hello Games!\n\nMaybe it's for the survival and resource management elements?....\n\n\"So, I need resource A, B and C to make tedious device X.... A and B are available in this system. Let's go!!\"\n....Ship out of take off fuel....\n\"Ok no problem, I'll just go gather some.....done, let's go!!!!\"\n....Flies to identical \"different\" planets. Spends 20 minutes mining and moving things around to make space...done....\n\"Now to go and get resource C from the next system, let's go!!!\"\n....No hyperspace fuel. Gather resource D, E and F....\n\"Urghhh, OH-KAY. D and E are available here....the F is available on planet...screw it, I'll buy it from the space station...let's go!!\"\n....Ship out of take off fuel....\n\"Noooo problemmm, I'll just go gather som......nah F*** this F****** BULLS****, I'm going to work, where I will actually be paid real money for driving myself to an early stress related death!\"\n\nI even tried the free mode, which just demonstrated to me how pointless this game is. Mining and moving resources around really is all this game has. Once you remove them, it's got nothing!\n\nIt's such a weird game. It has the graphics of a childs Nintendo game from about 10 years ago, but the tedium and complexity of a grown up simulator. It seems the game was made for an audience that never existed. 9 year old beurocrats and accountants!\nIt's also shuddery, even on a powerful system! \n\nHate is a strong word, but it's pretty fitting! How this got \"mostly positive\" I will never know. You guys have LOOOOOW standards! Or you are all evil geniuses, that wanted others to suffer as you did! Damn yee!!\n\nI so wish I had trusted my gut and refunded this garbage asap.

Everyone avoided this game like the plague when it first came out. This game was awful, unfun, boring.\n\nBut whispers were creeping among the internet discussions that No Man's Sky had actually been updated enough to be enjoyable. And that is where my curiosity made me pay $60 for a game that no one liked.\n\nSo, is this game worth the price in 2017? Yes. I can't imagine how dissapointed people were when it was first released. But this game is addicting, fun to explore, adds mystery and wanderlust. It is a lot of resource gathering, but when you get into it you know exactly what you need to get to advance your goals. Want to build a home? Go ahead. Want to save up money to buy a gigantic space ship? For 80,000,000 you can be the captain of an Imperial Star Destroyer. Want to traverse the universe? The galaxy is your oyster.\n\nI never thought I would be writing this review... But No Man's Sky is a good game. This is one of those rare times when the developer actually brought this game back from the brink of awful.", "pos_sent": 0.12, "neg_sent": 0.095, "review_example": "NOTE:  I bought this game at the onset of Atlas Rises Update.\n\nI was told about this game from a friend of mine who also plays open world survival games.  I have a deep love for the genre and its provided me countless hours of enjoyment in virtual worlds.  When the release date actually arrived, I found myself caught in a dilemna because it became readily apparent just how much of a stir Hello Games prompted but didn't deliver.  I felt that the community reacted very poorly to it.  I didn't purchase it.\n\nIf there is one thing that life has taught me in all my years is that is best to wait and let things cook for a little while longer.  In the age of Pre-alpha and beta games (I refuse to buy into them) I've really noticed a hot trend of garbage games coming into their own over time.  That is usually when I'll buy into them.  This also allows me to skip and fast forward past the Content Zergs who overload servers and then leave and go whine on the forums why things didn't work out for them.  I just can't be a part of that anymore.  Coincidentally I also never see movies on opening night either.  lol.\n\nI'm so glad I waited.  While I do notice that large groups of vocal folk will pass this game over because of its procedural generation (a common complaint is how random but formulaic procedural generation is, and they'd be correct to say so.) the real reward in my humble opinion is on the strange and rare occasions where things just fall into place.  That's the real gold and often the food for some of the most wonderful screenshots that players conjure.  Sure you'll run into a droning system of odd analogues but then there's always that one memorable system that totally jumps at you.   Those are fun feels for creative people, and I consider that my meat and drink in No Man's Sky.\n\nThe Good is that many difficulties and goals are now overcome, and the developers (Sean Murray included) continue to press on and make their game better.  In a year if I look back, I wonder how far have the changes gone?  Will I even recognize old haunts anymore?  There are already reviews in play that already say so from a year back from players that bought in at launch.  Multiplayer as of now (Atlas Rises 1.35 update) is still shaky, but there are changes coming down the pipe and I even heard a rumour about global chat.  I'm excited for that change.  I love tradeskilling, and I want more of it.\n\nThe Bad is that there are still some bugs that really impact the little things.   Collision and hit box sizes can be janky but mostly not harmful unless you find yourself slipping through the terrain into the netherworld.  Procedural generation often finds a way to make common things even more common, and thus less special.   Ships are not entirely customizable nor can they be built.   You can't upgrade unless you get an entirely new ship.  I find that the empty slots between equipment, cause me to loose a lot of valuable time ship hunting because I'll find just the RIGHT aesthetic but then what's under the hood is disappointing.  I'll find ships that are well configured in slots, but will be very weak in terms of stats.\nNo matter how much cash you have, its never enough.   Nanites eventually loose their value over time, due to owning all the blueprints.   You can quickly go from tutorial to end game if you're smart enough to take advantage of both trading and tradeskilling.  By the time you own a Freighter, any freighter, most of your problems are already going away in normal mode.   Much of the game has been polished to the degree they proposed back in the beginning, but that path is fraught with little problems that still need some attention.\n\nThe Ugly is when the new and the old community clash.   That's really the only thing that goes beyond reason for me.  Listening to the complaints of the first buyers and the overly whiny negativity gets old really fast.   Many of those folks just haven't gotten over their own disappointment.  Troll Culture is en vogue and critique with thoughtlessness brings everything down; even things you may normally enjoy.   Negativity is viral.  Wait for a sale if you are skeptical.  Never, ever read the comments.\n\nAt the time of this review, im over 340 hours with this game, and I've completed all the main and side quests.  I'm not filthy rich, but im comfortable enough to spend most of my time tweaking my basebuilding skills, or just exploring.  I'm an avid shiphunter.  The theme and the story are very much couched in existentialism.  You're an explorer in a vast universe.  Why are you there?  What are you doing?  If those are not questions you are willing to wrestle with in No Man's Sky, then the game might not be for you.\n\nBut to re-iterate, the vastness is compelling when it does come together.   Warping over to the next galaxy hoping to see and interact with something unique?   Suddenly, a violent storm or attack sends you on a spiral?  The best times in the game for me are when I'm struggling.  If that has any appeal to you, then No Man's Sky is definitely for you.", "topics": ["updates", "regret", "refund"]}, {"time_of_review": "2017-10-13T01:26:42", "percent_window": 0.6577181208053692, "review": "Got this game when it first came out, turns out it was bascially Flight simulator in space.

Since launch a ton of new features have been added - there is an incredible amount to do and see, I've barely scratched the surface.\n\nWhile I tend to prefer more \"realistic\" space games (Elite Dangerous - I'm a backer with >1000 hours in Elite) there's simply no denying that there's more to do in NMS.  Since starting Survival mode (for tougher difficulty) I've probably spent 10 hours on 1 planet alone; one with no wildlife but a milder climate that allowed me to explore in relative peace and hunt for bigger and better ships.  And NPC difficulty has been upped too - I love getting my rear end kicked by low level space pirates in my low level ship; that's the way it should be.  All in all: I recommend this game to anyone who likes variety, exploration, a space theme, a bit of a challenge and the constant thrill associated with finding better stuff.

And still the content is not even close to the presentations that were made before realising the game. Besides the planets look really nice sometimes (which comes hand in hand with an insane fps drop) the animal are still laughable. For example: They are hunting now...you knwo what they do? They jump on the other animals and after killing they go away. And yes the killing animation looks like 15 years ago because there is no fcking killing animation. Really it looks like you have a T-Rex Action Figure and let him fight with another Action Figure. Bumping them togheter :D.  I have a i5 4690K and a nvidia gtx 1060 6gb, booth of them are overclocked. So still can ply AC Origins on the highest settings (FHD) and I have most of the time 60fps. Yes the game with most beautiful Open World of all times. Exactly that. But on NMS on planets with a little more flora I have drops down to 30fps and thats not even a rare event. I had set the settings to lowest AA, 4x  Antostropic Filtering, Medium Light and Medium shadow. No HBAO No Light Tunnels. Thats just ridiculous. And fcking no I dont want to turn off the VSync. IIts no online Shooter and I hate the tearing (playing it on tv with xbox Controller)  So for me it seeks out that the guys on Hello Games maybe have nice design dreams but there are some middle talented programmers. The Engine is just crap and I dont think it will be repaired in the future. The objects still poping up 5metres in front of you. I have not gained more fps since the release of the game. (and at that time I had R9 290x amd)  If you change the graphic settings there is no and I mean NO difference on the fps. I played it on 720p to confirm my guess and yes I had 30fps on the same spot with 720p ! Its unbelievable. The lifeforms still the same crap every talk is exactly the same. Oke its not a Star Citizen but is it too much requiring to meet some NPC Travellers on the worlds time by time? Too much requiring to have at least some villages (no cities, thats oke) time by time? No the NPCs exactly the same since the day of release.  A simple scene that will never happen: Oh hey what you doing out here? Oh youre an explorer and seeking out for new animals? I should help you? Of course. -> Nooope. There is nobody, no NPC out there. Still only...help me with the dialect. Ohhhh thnx how much fun...to answer it. ZERO. But there are some new aspects that are quiet funny now.

The Foundation Update, Path Finder Update, and Atlas Rises Update all changed the game in meaningful ways\u2014mostly for the better. Many old issues remain and some newer issues have arisen\u2014e.g., farming no longer seems to be the viable business it once was and top-quality starships and frigates seem to be unattainable now\u2014but No Man's Sky is now a much better game than it was in August of 2016.\n\n\nAugust 25, 2016 Update:\n\nAfter switching from a 21:9 display to a standard 1080p display and adjusting the settings in GeForce Experience, I was able to get the game running full screen. Even so, the frame rate would drop so low that the game would become barely playable even after turning the graphical settings all the way down. This is on a very capable gaming system that runs other recent games, including Fallout 4, very well: it has an eight-core (4 physical, 8 logical) AMD FX-8370 CPU, a 2GB GeForce GTX 750 Ti, 16GB of main memory, and an SSD.\n\nAfter multiple patches, I have still seen the game drop as low as 8 frames per second. The game does now seem to run better for a while, but its frame rate drops frequently. Sometimes it recovers, but sometimes it stays down for a long time and I end up restarting to get it running faster again. It's just too hard to fight combat sentinels or pirates at 8 to 12fps!\n\nApart form the poor performance, the game has numerous other issues. For a while it refused to resume after Alt+Tabbing out or losing game focus to a Windows sticky keys prompt, but after one of the updates I was able to get back in. One of the most annoying problems in game is that the game sometimes loses all of my objective markers; it seems to have something to do with reloading.\n\nSome gameplay elements are either not described or not described well, including automatic and custom way points. A manual of some sort might be helpful.\n\nThe procedural planet and animal generation gets old fast. Here's a hippo head with gazelle horns. Here's a dog with a thing on its back. Here's a dog with a different thing on its back. Here's an aggressive cave crab. Here's a slightly different timid crab. A dinosaur with a small head. A dinosaur with a weird head. Lots and lots and lots of basically the same stuff, none of which seems to look nearly as good as the preview pictures and video. Frankly, No Man's Sky seems like a pretty ugly game. Even most of the ships seem ugly.\n\nAlien ineractions are ridiculous. Every sentient humanoid alien seems to be little more than a mannequin. They're no more mobile than an animatronic character from Chuck E. Cheese or Disneyland and perhaps less animated than many. They don't even sit or stand. When the story involves you taking an action such as punching a warrior alien, it happens via text and an on-screen notification. There might be a red flash on the screen.\n\nIt gets worse.\n\nThe user interface is terrible from the slow ring-filling clicks to the slowly appearing text to the moving inventory to the space map that sends your view all over the place. For years to come, No Man's Sky will serve as a fine example of what to NOT do when designing a user interface unless it is a designer's goal to make a UI so horrible that it distracts one from a game's other flaws.\n\nAnd there are plenty of them. I found a distress signal that seemed to emit from nothing in empty space and that seems to be an appropriate metaphor for the game overall: it looked like something worthwhile was going to be there, but no, it seems to have been a waste of time.\n\nUltimately, No Man's Sky is basically a simple grind for materials, technology upgrades, and inventory slots. You will probably find the same tech blueprints again and again until you stop bothering to even check all of the potential sources for new ones. The game can be compelling in some ways, but it is very repetetive and not actually very fun, especially when it is running slowly or my hard-earned objective markers all disappear.\n\nThe best part of No Man's Sky is probably the story that unfolds a couple lines or so at a time. Hello Games could have just written a book and spared us this collection of technical and design failures.\n\n\nOriginal August 12 Review:\n\nThus far, the game is barely playable. It launches in windowed mode, it won't let me change to full-sceen mode, it won't let me change the resoultion from its default, and it even failed to quit to the desktop via its own interface option to do so, so I had to quit via Alt+F4.

I've still got some hope that Hello Games will do something with their flagship title.  If you are reading the reviews for this game I am sure you are no doubt aware of the many flaws, lies and bugs with this game.  Instead of boring you with more of the same kind of hype train meltdown, I'll focus on the TWO things that did it for me.\n\n1. Ships\n\nOr lack thereof.  There is quite litterally, absolutely NO difference between any of the ships except for cosmetics.  I know Sean Murray explicitly mentioned ship variety in several videos, but none of that exists, period.  Each ship has \"slots\" and its very easy to spend a dozen hours on a single planet finding all the crashed ships.  (And why does every single planet have dozens, even hundreds of crashed ships?  more on that later).  \n\nEvery crashed ship you find has a chance to have 1 extra slot than the ship you are currently flying, and you hop off your current ship and into your new one.  That's No Man's Sky's ship progression.  Use use these slots evenly for engine/weapon upgrades and for storing items.  Slots are what matter, the more slots you have the more upgrades you can fit.  Once you hit 30 or so slot ships you can fit all upgrades.\n\n2. Life\n\nEVERY SINGLE PLANET has way too much life, there's abandoned structures, yes, but there's too much \"signs of life\" too many crashed ships, too many outposts, too many structures for life to matter in this game.  All planets have the same \"algorithm\" that generate all these structures, crashed ships, outposts, satellites, etc.  There's no difference between barren planets and lush planets, each have the same \"signs of life\" ALL OVER the planet.\n\n18 quintillion plannets, and every single one of them is generated with the same ruleset, there's just too much life for it to matter in this game, there's just too much of everything for it to matter.\n\nAnd that's the main point that's the main problem of the game for me, each planet has everything, and when each planet has everything you could discover, it all becomes moot and nothing is special anymore.  The Taj Mahal is special because there's only one, but this game is like, \"no, every state and country get's a Taj Mahal\" instantly making the Taj Mahal no longer special and no longer matter.", "pos_sent": 0.078, "neg_sent": 0.083, "review_example": "Veri nice mi frend", "topics": ["gameplay", "planet", "10"]}, {"time_of_review": "2016-11-04T00:06:14", "percent_window": 0.12048192771084337, "review": "Months have passed now, and rather than complete the content they led people to expect or even flesh out the game further, it has instead been abandoned.

There is no real survival besides topping up energy into your magic suit. You can't starve or die of thirst etc. If you do happen to die you simply respawn at your last save point.\nAs a space adventure game the it fails miserably as the controls and ships are shocking.  Upgrades as such appear to do very little if anything and space pirates are a waste of time and give you no reward anyway.  If you run into any, simply load your previous save and they'll be gone!?\nAs an exploration game its a real failure as its boring and repetitive planets and wild life etc.  Planets have no real weather, no biomes, no day cycle besides a cheesy skybox effect.  Theres no planetary orbits etc. There is no differences where you land as the WHOLE planet is near identical. No deserts going into hills going into snow etc. just boring.\nAnimal life is interesting in looks to a degree but no animals have any real intelligence or AI.  They simply run around in circles and get stuck lots.  THey all behave identical to each other.\nThe aliens are all based on half a dozen models and once you've met 10 or so you've pretty well seen it all.

You cant slow down and hover to look around for something. \n\nYou can't turn your head in the cockpit (on pc anyway)\n\nIf you want to land you hit a button and it auto lands, most of the time not where you wanted.\n\nDid I mention you can't stop and hover? Well let me mention it again. From the moment you take off you are hauling ass until you hit auto land making exploring a major pain in the ass.\n\nWhile flying you will see \"?\" appear wich indicate a point of interest to land at but they randomly just disappear and reappear in front of you.\n\nA lot of the time you may not want to land at a place because the fuel requirements for taking off are just dumb (side note: plutonium fuel is required for flying above ground but iron for fuel while in space wtf?) But anyway sometimes its ust not worth stopping at a place because it takes so much fuel to launch again and often times you cant even see the place you potentially would like to land at because you are going to fast, its obsucured by a hill and pointing the ship down is just not an option which leads me to next point.\n\nTrying to look down while flying is just the most infuriating shit I have ever done in any game. The ship resists this to the max and ultimately you just flip upside down like a broken toy flying in some kind of weird ass direction. Seriousl, there are real people who designed it this way and someone saw it and said YES! I mean wtf are these devs even thinking.\n\nEverything about flying hinders exploration which is the main point of this game is it not? I mean i don't need a realistic flight sim here. Just some very basic shit listed above. I can play elite or ksp for more complicated flying.\n\nWhen you land you get booted out of your ship wether you like it or not. If landing on a landing pad it kicks your ass off the pad itself onto the dirt smdh.\n\nThe ony difference in ships is the amount of inventory slots and the way the ship looks? Seriously wtf? I found a couple of crashed ships, got so excited about this. Oh cool that ship looks badass..way better than mine. I can fix this ship and just take it? hell yea. Well its got triple the amount of inventory slots but they are 90% all broken. No problem i can fix those. 100,000 units per slot? (units are money in the game) ummm ok...fix a few, now its 250,000 for some more slots.. seriously why? It wouldve been cheaper to just buy one in the starport. What a cool feature totally ruined. Why didnt they make it so you had to make repair compenents to fix, so you could grind out some resources and craft. Nope fuck it lets just make it cost money and be done with it. Lazy.\n\nBeyond flying my main complaints are just confirmation about what many other reviews have said about the repetitve nature of the game.\n\nExtreme lack of variety. Its like saying I have and endless amount of cups in my kitchen and they are all different but in reality they are all the same cup style with some diff colors and inside the exact same thing maybe a diff color but there is no reason to look beyond the first cup, you have seen all the rest.\n\nEvery game needs a hook, especially survival games. The only hook in the game is to grind for more inventory slots, so you can hold more stuff needed to sell so you can get more inventory slots and that is just about it. \n\nI'm pretty sure the devs copied the inside of a space station, ya know the single one they designed, and pasted it to every single space staion in the game. Its so boring please kill me now.\n\nI can't say enough about how many times you will run inside the exact same buildings answering the exact same questions when presented with a puzzle. All the stuff inside is the same. And this is 99% of everything everwhere.  \n\nI'm not one of the people who followed this game or the hype. I don't give a crap about the lies or whatever the devs did or didnt say. I just waited for this to go on sale. I'm not paying $60 for a game with overwhelemingly negative reviews warranted or not but these Hello Games people or whoever is in charge of that decision are stupid as hell apparently. I got this on steam summer sale. $24 i think. In my just everyday guy worthless opinion I think the game is worth about $15 so not too bad of a mistake.\n\nThings i liked:\n\nI will admit I didnt have any performance issues, crashes or bugs which is great.\n\nThe best thing about the game is using the scanner to identify plants and widlife then renaming them and uploading to server.\n\nThe creatures you encounter are so damn ugly and misshapen they are just a hiilarious addition to the game although laughing at them probably isnt what the devs had in mind, me and the kids had fun with that.\n\nReally trying to be fair here but I can't think of much else I liked besides the art and colors looking great.\n\nWell I could spend more time on this but why bother?

It's more of a toy. Think Spore, but focused on exploration from a ground level, first person pov. In the same way that Spore, Sim City, and Sims titles fail to have an interesting end game or goal, so does this. It's a strange generative universe with odd things to stumble upon. Unlike Sims games, though, it's not even really built to \"entertain\". This is a very \"hard sci-fi\" kind of game. The interest here is in pondering the nature of this artificial universe and soaking in a very specific kind of tone that isn't present in sci-fi much these days. It has no grit, very little conflict, and what few \"characters\" exist aren't really interested in getting to know you or vice-versa. There is no \"adventure\" to be had here, nor is this supposed to be Space Minecraft.\nAnother way to think of this is as a super-massive, sci-fi version of Proteus. I recommend you approach this game in the same way. If you didn't enjoy Proteus, you have no reason to expect enjoying this. Expect little in the way of guidance on how to have fun or instructions telling you what's worth accomplishing. This is very much like *actually* exploring the endless cosmos. Sometimes there just isn't much of interest, and on occasion you see something neat and interesting.

By disaster, I mean the response it received (Mostly negative reviews on Steam). With this review, I am going to try and hopefully make an unbiased review, Optimization stating my opinion. I hope that you will find this review helpful.\n\nThe hype\n\nThere was some extreme hype for this game, and unfortunately, the game did not reach expectations. It is missing a multitude of features promised, most notably multiplayer. If you come from the hype train (which I'm sure anyone that did has either bought the game or seen it) then prepare do be very disappointed. This is NOT what was promised, instead of a shadow of what we expected.\n\nNow, I did come on the hype train, and whilst being able to easily notice the missing features, was not overly disappointed (my explanation to this is stated later).\n\nContent\n\nNo doubt, this game has a MASSIVE amount of content. Or \"Content\" I should put it as. I put the quotation marks around it because any game with 18 quintillion planets (that's 18,000,000,000,000,000,000 planets) is bound to create a game with loads of content, but the individual content isn't something to write home about. Whilst you can explore, you can discover, you can build, travel, trade and more, it does get boring and over repetitive (I should know after 80 hours!). Also, planets do seem to have some striking similarities between one another, but that was and is to be expected. But they are still individual enough to want me to continue to explore.\n\nFor me, the content was enjoyable, but did get extremely boring after a while, and made me question how on earth I squeezed 80 hours out of this game.\n\nOptimisation / how well the game runs\n\nHave a good PC, not good enough. You need a superb PC to get good fps with high graphics settings. My specs are as follows:\n\n16gb ddr3 ram\nAMD fx 6300 processor\nAMD Radeon r9 270 GPU\n\nWith those specs, I get 30-45 fps on medium graphics, which aren't too bad, but I would quite like to erase the LAG SPIKES I get very often. But, this is to be expected, since, I mean, 18 quintillion planets, that's quite a lot...\n\nGraphics\n\nThe graphics are pretty good, again nothing to write home about. Their style is very distinct and some visuals are very impressive. Lighting is pretty decent, texture quality could be better but overall, for the graphics side of things, the game gets it pretty good there.\n\nSo, what does the game achieve?\n\nWell, the game achieves what it's meant to be - a space exploration game. It achieves this well, too. there is plenty to explore, plenty to find, and is a cool universe to explore.\n\nThe law is great, I love the law.

I bought the game when it was drastically reduced, and I can say it is not worth a full price tag by any means. I think I paid $20 for it and that was well worth it at that price point.\n\nYou enjoy exploration/survival games. I could play Minecraft for hours. Just zoning out and building bases or exploring dark caves really appeals to me. Much in the same way people like to relax and play Truck Simulator, I can sit down and zone out to the peaceful music of No Man's Sky while exploring planets and gathering materials. If you are looking for a deep and compelling story this is not really the game for you.\n\nYou are not looking for an engaging multiplayer experience. This game is not built for multiplayer, despite what people may have thought or may have been advertised. From what I know it is possible to go to other players bases, but I have not done so. In my travels I have never encountered another player and I think that is by game design but I could be wrong.\n\nAs long as those three guidlines are in effect I would advise you to grab the game. It is relaxing and fun for me to zip around the universe and discover new planets. After the first 20 hours or so you will begin to see that most of the planets are quite similar to ones previously visited with minor differences, however every once in a while I will make a discovery that makes me want to keep going. Base building is a cool feature for you to store some of your crafting materials and gives you a place of your own in the universe. The developers put out some pretty frequent updates that seem to consistently make improvements to the game which is a good sign to me. I have noticed that the game has occassional glitches that sometimes can be a major problem, but it has not hindered me enough to stop playing.

I didn't really buy into the hype, and was pleasantly surprised (after the first week of patches). \nThis is not a true sim by any means; it is a much more meditative experience, and doesn't require your constant engagement. It also runs on my toaster of a laptop at a \"good enough\" 25-35fps, without noticeable stutters.\n\nIt's a very niche game, and at $60, it warrants its controversy; it doesn't really do anything new, and doesn't do anything thoroughly, except creating planets for you to explore. Mile wide and inch deep, sure, but that mile sure is wide. The data logs you find from abandoned buildings and monoliths weave an intricate story, the slow acquisition of languages and reliance on context clues to talk with the alien races have me running around to learn as much as possible. \n\nI've spent 23 hours on this game so far, and I've not yet left my starter planet; there's still tons to explore and loads to do, you just have to create your own depth.\n\n**Update**\nAt 42 hours, I finally redeemed the pre-order ship, after entering my second system. Each new planet I land on is thrilling, never knowing what the flora and fauna will be. The space battles with pirates are exhilirating, as I weave through asteroids and fumble my way through the ship inventory (Hello Games, fix this) to recharge my shields before exploding into dust.\n\n**Update 2**\nIt's been a year since release, and with 200+ hours it's still pretty engaging. HG keeps pushing out major content updates (Hello \"multiplayer\") that actually adds to the game, as opposed just cosmetic fixes and/or irrelevant patches.\n\n**Update 3**\nThe game remains engaging even after I've reached the center of a few galaxies and warped to the next. It would be nice to see a little more flora/fauna variety, (you get a bunch of repeating shapes b/c of procgen) and maybe more customization options. The devs have continued to listen and push out major updates (akin to DLC) for free, as well as continually optimizing the game and listening to player feedback.

I didn't start over from scratch, but I did play through the official Atlas Elevates quest line. It's not unfortunate. Without spoiling it, I can verbally express you will learn a lot about the backstory of the three sapient lifeforms, and your own story as well. It will additionally introduce the beginning mission system and some incipient factions.\n\nAs I mentioned in my aperture tirade, the incipient update resets an abundance of what came afore. The planet engenderer has been revamped, and in the process, all antecedent planets were regenerated. That pulchritudinous, lush paradise, that was your favorite hang-out? Gone -- superseded by an incipiently engendered world. It might still be nice or might be a wasteland. That is categorically exasperating in the world where you secure your base. And if you built components of your base outside the defined boundary, those components will be gone, additionally.\n\nThe worlds you discovered and designated still subsist -- marginally. You discovered them; They're on your list, and yet you must re-discover them again. When you scan for creatures, the historic ones you observed afore are still listed, but they are not around anymore, and there are incipient ones. It's authentically extraordinary.\n\nI'm not sure why the discovered worlds couldn't have been preserved. Resetting them considers no impact on incipient players, but it's upsetting to the veterans who've devoted the most time playing, and the most time fortifying this game. It seems short-sighted.\n\nI was so dejected about the transmutations to my habitation planet that I decided to move away. Far, a long way away. After completing the Atlas Elevating quest, I peregrinated all the way out to the 10th galaxy, which is denominated Eissentam. The No Man's Welkin' Gamepedia reports it seems to have a more astronomically immense number of lush planets that other galaxies, which I cerebrated sounded nice. I found a pretty place to build an incipient base and am settling in quite well.\n\n[quote=author] Tanner Golden\t[/quote]\n\n[b] HARDWARE REQ\t[/b]\nRequires a 64-bit processor and operating system\nOS: Windows 7/8.1/10 (64-bit versions)\nProcessor: Intel Core i3\nMemory: 8 GB RAM\nGraphics: nVidia GTX 480, AMD Radeon 7870\nStorage: 10 GB available space\n\n\u2611 [b] Reccomended\t[/b]\n\n[b] GAMEPLAY\t[/b]\n\u2610 (8.0-10)\n\u2611 (6.0-7.9)\n\u2610 (4.0-5.9)\n\u2610 (2.0-3.9)\n\u2610 (0-1.9)\n\n[b] GRAPHICS\t[/b]\n\u2610 (8.0-10) MASTERPIECE\n\u2611 (6.0-7.9) GREAT\n\u2610 (4.0-5.9) OKAY\n\u2610 (2.0-3.9) AWFUL\n\u2610 (0-1.9) DISASTER\n\n[b] ONLINE\t[/b]\n\u2610 (8.0-10)\n\u2610 (6.0-7.9)\n\u2610 (4.0-5.9)\n\u2611 (2.0-3.9)\n\u2610 (0-1.9)\n\n[h1][b] OVERALL RATING\t[/b][/h1]\n\n\u2611 [b] 73.5\t[/b]", "pos_sent": 0.125, "neg_sent": 0.068, "review_example": "I gave it a chance and I actauly liked it even though i was prepared to hate it, Its a bit expensive but it has decent game play", "topics": ["ship", "planet", "relax"]}, {"time_of_review": "2018-05-01T14:11:28", "percent_window": 0.7, "review": "For me this is a good  game,\nI am quite hardcore when it comes to game, which means I have not googled anything about it(except I cheated and googled since I didn't find any map key/functionality, but there is not such thing in game)\nI have around 80 hours in game after just over a week and a half now, so something must the game do right :-)\n\nFor me it's a low intensity explorer game, very little adrenaline, just pure exploration, discovery of planets fauna, Flora etc.\nI have just started doing missions :-)\n\nFor me it really brought me back to Elite on c64, but more polished and lacking in some other aspects.\nI strongly recommend this game for a narrow group of people which are hard core explorers, other groups I don't know if they find this game interesting.", "pos_sent": 0.135, "neg_sent": 0.044, "review_example": "Started out rough, but since recent updates, it may be one of the most beautiful games I have ever played.
