Technical issues riddle through it and that is a huge issue. Preformance for me specifically is fine and I pretty much have the recommended specs on all highest so that's something. I hear and have seen a lot of others getting hit by dips in fps and cpus running up to 100% for seemingly no reason. I mean this game is pretty but its basically a console texture job so the preformance is completely unwarranted. \n\nMy issue, and the issue that I think is what needs to be addressed post friggin haste is the communication errors. Holy christ almighty they are rampant and they are annoying. I mean its a big game and idk how big Capcom expected this game to be or how much of an audience it expected to pull but this far after release and no patch, well let's just say it smells fishy. \n\nI will say I think this game has been getting a VERY unfair shake by some communities stemming from *cough*Reddit*cough* and the little lynch mobs they like to employ but they are entitled to their opinions but I will say that KB+M is fine with some tweaking. I found the ranged controls unsavory but not 40% positive reviews unsavory. The preformance is an issue absolutely but again not warranted of the collapsing public opinion this game is experiencing. However I get the sentiment for a $60 game you want things done right. Controller is fine, I genuinely don't understand why people are throwing fit after fit becasue of it unless they are using some obscure pad. xbox controllers are adequate if not good. \n\nThe heart of this game's issue, if I had to guess, is Denuvo. I loathe Denuvo, which isn't an unshared opinion. I am willing to place a lot of the technical issues this game is experiencing at Denuvo's feet and I wouldn't be surprised if that comes out later and Capcom does nothing. \n\nI recommend the game but under conditions. This game just does better, in my experience, in single player. I get it, its not the traditional MonHun experience to play alone all day but if its what you were going for anyways then you are in a good place. Another condition is this: If it does come out that Denuvo is the cause of 1080 ti's running sub 60 fps, or the cause of massive CPU usage spike, constant data leaks or those god forsaken communication errors, if that comes out and Capcom does not respond accordingly: Do not buy this game. If they want to prove that their precious corporate interest and pet DRM is more important in the face of good will and market research then let it be but until then, give them a fair shake.

Sink 40 hours in this bad boy and tell me it's unplayable trash. \n\nScoutflies are bad sometimes. Learn the map and you won't need them as much. \n\nGreat game, recommend it for anyone who loves co-op games and doesn't mind some grinding.

Every year, hopeful that a new version would be released on the newer generation of playstation consoles. I even had hoped it might move over to xbox just so I could get my fix. The hope never left me.\n\nNow! It is here! In all it's graphical beauty. I may have moved on to the PC stage and am happy to do so. I am in awe. I was truly blown away during what I believed was a cutscene, but was amazed when I was viewing my player with all his detail and equipment during the movies. As I changed gear and new cutscenes emerged, so too would my characters image during the playback. What a time. \n\nIf you're in for a grindfest, repeatedly killing monsters that are akin to Lightning Unicorns or Firebreathing Dragons or perhaps a Water Snake with constant evolving/devolving legs with different difficulties or maybe you'd like to try your hand at a Bomb-dropping Armadillo, then this is the game for you. \n\nNeed the gear to be better equiped at the monster you're killing? You'll have to kill that monster multiple times. It's satisfying when you clearing a quest and have achieved victory. \n\nThere are multiple weapons to use based on your preference with different attributes that you can craft as you farm the monsters you battle. You can craft gear based on the monsters as well (although you'll have to defeat them several times for the pieces you need). Then there are charms. A single item you can bring with you that gives you another boost to a skill, based on the amount you have upgraded it. Then, there is jewelry. Certain weapons/armor have slots you can place these jewels for another boost. The possibilities are endless.\n\nThe community has been great. It's very easy to drop in and out of parties and everyone is, generally, very welcoming.\n\nThe farming never stops and you'll get well worth what you've paid for.

Almost. The basic premise of an open world game where you just hunt and kill massive monsters and make stuff with the drops is really fun and indeed, most of the time in game it IS fun. However, in pretty much every other aspect, the game falls apart hard.\n\nClearly, MH:W is made to be played multiplayer. Yet they make playing multiplayer as annoying as can be. Almost every single main story (more on this later) has useless cutscenes scattered throughout them, and you CAN'T have anyone in your game with you until you have gotten through each and every cutscene in the given mission. So instead of bringing a group of people through a mission, you need to start the mission solo, progress through until you've exhausted the pointless cutscenes, at which point you have to launch an SOS Flare and have people join mid mission. THIS IS NOT FUN, OR CONVENIENT.\n\nMH:W's story is garbage. Its one of the worst, most boring, tacked on stories I've ever attempted playing through. The characters are annoying and useless, and they make EVERYTHING happen in long, drawn out, unskippable cutscenes that really just serve to waste your time. If they had just cut away any and all story elements from this game, and released a free roam, open world monster hunting game, it would have been a much better experience.\n\nFinally, the tutorials. The game makers felt the need to bloat the hell out of this game with every single possible system that could possibly be fit into an RPG. People might see this and say, \"you're just dumb; everything in this game is tutorialized\" to which I say, correct. Each and every system, of which there are so many, has a \"tutorial\" that amounts to a page or 2 of text that you have to read through, then close before using said system. YOU WILL NOT REMEMBER ANY OF THIS. It's almost worse that they even have these pop up tutorial windows because you just get so fed up with them (if you're like me) that you just end up desperately mashing your way through them to play the game, after you've already wasted your time on unskippable cutscenes, slow moving escort missions, and useless character dialogue that you don't care about.", "upvoted": false, "time_of_review_unix": 1537144368, "upvotes_window": 707, "total_window": 837, "percent_window": 84.46833930704899, "neu_sent": 0.777, "neg_sent": 0.126, "pos_sent": 0.097, "comp_sent": -0.9327, "neu_window": 0.6802732696897373, "neg_window": 0.08389140811455835, "pos_window": 0.23107637231503567, "comp_window": 0.4097472553699288, "percent_window_roc": 0.858426852180978, "neu_window_roc": 0.9631776338220253, "neg_window_roc": 0.7257949308102654, "pos_window_roc": 0.7287106068733799, "comp_window_roc": 0.8599438311618081, "1day_forecast": -0.0015461381685291098, "1day_delta": -0.011792686276067887, "pos_predict": 0.003079399290821111, "neg_predict": 0.15961449200700617}, {"time_of_review": "2018-09-18T00:29:11", "review": "One of the best games I've ever played.\n\nBUT :\n- The game takes 100% of my overclocked i5-6600k\n- Some bosses make your FPS drop to 15\n\nCan't recommend this game in it's current state.", "upvoted": true, "time_of_review_unix": 1537230551, "upvotes_window": 645, "total_window": 765, "percent_window": 84.31372549019608, "neu_sent": 0.751, "neg_sent": 0.138, "pos_sent": 0.111, "comp_sent": -0.2535, "neu_window": 0.6746997389033942, "neg_window": 0.08564621409921654, "pos_window": 0.23313707571801592, "comp_window": 0.39514477806788545, "percent_window_roc": 0.859189855882711, "neu_window_roc": 0.9641924654979486, "neg_window_roc": 0.724971006493305, "pos_window_roc": 0.721090491234112, "comp_window_roc": 0.8662846189646061, "1day_forecast": 0.005994921333019154, "1day_delta": -0.0015461381685291098, "pos_predict": 0.0022100466970963882, "neg_predict": 0.1471940980681267}, {"time_of_review": "2018-09-19T00:21:45", "review": "Monster Hunter World PC : Good Game, Bad port, Don\u2019t recommend at this time.\nUPDATED REVIEW: STILL NEGATIVE.\n\nThe MH series is great make no mistake, and it was a given that MHW was going to be somewhat different from previous titles due to the intended audience. That audience being players new to the series. As such the game has been softened and otherwise streamlined to be more accessible. For some MH purists this will be a negative, for others a positive. For me, I\u2019m on the fence, some changes I like, others not so much, however my primary points of contention with MHW PC is the quality of the port.\nI will not be going into direct detail with in-game mechanics and features such as monster Ai, and the removal of Gunner and Blademaster specific armours, but rather the more generalised overall picture. It would do a disservice to outright list the pro\u2019s and cons of MHW over its predecessors specifically as the core game hasn\u2019t changed much over its previous titles, as such there are more cons than pro\u2019s in a simple list.\nThe move from hand helds to current gen Console\u2019s and PC however can be described as follows:\n\nThe \u201cPro\u2019s\u201d can be generalised to; \u201cMonster Hunter world is finally on a more powerful platform than hand helds. PS4, XBOX and of course the far superior PC, allow it to stretch its legs without too many hardware restrictions.\u201d\n\nThe \u201ccons\u201d for the PC version specifically can be generalised to \u201cMonster Hunter World has suffered somewhat due to poor porting from Console to PC, resulting in some fairly significant bugs, and terrible performance, that mar an otherwise great game\u201d\n\nThis negative review is to reflect the poor job done by Capcom in regards to the port that took 7 months of extra time over that of the original Console release.\n\nSpecifics: \nThe following details what I consider to be the top issues with MHW PC that make it deserving of a negative review until such a time that these issues have been remedied.\n\nThe most talked about issue is the poor connectivity of multiplayer resulting in frequent disconnections from party play. THIS HAS NOW BEEN MORE OR LESS FIXED.\n\nEnd game save file corruption. THIS BUG HAS BEEN FOUND TO BE CAUSED BY MISSING VIDEO CODECS ON THE USERS END. Downloading and install updated codecs solves the issue. \n\nOptimization.\nA big point of contention, MHW for PC has terrible optimisation, with even the recommended system specs reflecting this by listing current gen Mid tier gaming hardware for just 30 FPS figures at only 1080p resolution. Actual in game performance shows up areas of extreme FPS loss below this target regardless of system specifications, and game engine limitations restrict top end FPS to around 120 even with all settings at their lowest and at 720p running on a modern i7 and a 1080ti GPU. In addition to this certain graphical options show significant FPS loss with little visual fidelity gained. Capcom developers have tried to combat this by using Dynamic resolution scaling and variable LOD options in 3 out of the 4 default graphical profiles, however this results in massive visual fidelity loss in situations where FPS drops below set thresholds. Finally, the overall visual fidelity of the game is not considered high enough to warrant such high system requirements.\n\nGraphical bugs. The game runs with console textures, a point of issue, but even they do not always load up at their highest quality resulting in smudgy low quality textures being used in some cases. In addition to this, some options don\u2019t work, specifically 'reflections' which currently do not even match the quality of that of those on the console version.\n\nFollowing on from the above, MHW PC lacks some basic graphical options expected in most PC games, including but not limited to. FOV, DOF, Motion Blur, True AA, Upgraded textures, Bloom, Tessellation, Multiple Aspect Ratio Support.\n\nMouse implementation is another talked about issue the game has. The current mouse controls feel more like a restricted and badly implemented analogue stick emulation, rather than direct mouse input. As a result, the lower ones\u2019 framerate is, the worse the mouse feels, with it frequently being described as massive input lag.\n\nAlmost all the above points and issues should have and could have been dealt with prior to launch as, with the exception of network issues due to high load, they can all be found and easily seen by any competent QA team. \n\nEDIT2: A note on content. \nMHW has one of the lowest large monster counts out of all MH games at 34 after all DLC (not all on PC yet), beaten only by MHF (31) and MHTri (18) for games with the lowest count. \nThe highest being MHGU with over 90 large monsters.\nDont expect much more than 50 hours if your after the main storyline that includes all large monsters. After this point add another 50 hours to do 'endgame' content, grinding HR and farming jewels from the tougher versions of the same monsters (tempered).\n\nAs such my final verdict is. \u201cGreat game, bad port, Don\u2019t recommend at this time\u201d", "upvoted": false, "time_of_review_unix": 1537316505, "upvotes_window": 635, "total_window": 748, "percent_window": 84.89304812834224, "neu_sent": 0.786, "neg_sent": 0.105, "pos_sent": 0.11, "comp_sent": -0.2712, "neu_window": 0.6763190921228295, "neg_window": 0.08418558077436576, "pos_window": 0.2328317757009346, "comp_window": 0.3904527369826435, "percent_window_roc": 0.8582561568434992, "neu_window_roc": 0.9650963189013924, "neg_window_roc": 0.7296569614593011, "pos_window_roc": 0.71697211355832, "comp_window_roc": 0.8605532452131543, "1day_forecast": 0.012846669633361785, "1day_delta": 0.005793226381461625, "pos_predict": 0.0026306202691733344, "neg_predict": 0.11920140957087676}, {"time_of_review": "2018-09-20T00:36:56", "review": "As a monster hunter fan for years, OF COURSE IM SAYING BUY THIS.

Probably the worst is that you can't just bind items to vanilla 1, 2, 3 and other number keys (By \"vanilla\" I mean you push 1, you use that item, like in MMORPG games). You have to press F1 first to bring up a submenu, then press a number key. So for example to use grindstone on 1,  you have to press F1 then 1. There's no way to rebind the number keys.

Absolutely love the game despite the influx of negative reviews and multiplayer issues at launch. Capcom has resolved these issues, and multiplayer can now be fully enjoyable. I'd personally say that this is the best Monster Hunter game in the series, not necessarily in terms of content, but rather ease of playability such as the little quality of life features they've implemented into the game. This includes the incorporation of scoutflies and the removal of load screens between each area and the need to carry around a pickaxe/bug net. As a result this adds a better flow of gameplay, less time searching for monsters, and more time committed towards engaging them. However, the game does lack some features such as content, and lazy weapon designs. Capcom realizing this, has begun catering towards their audience, gradually adding more content. Overall this game is an absolute bang for the buck and worthwhile if you've never played Monster Hunter before. I recommend anyone who has negatively reviewed this product to reevaluate the updated and improved game it has become.

There's no 'fix' for it, don't bother looking.  Any fixes you find assume that you can't play any games online which isn't the problem.  It occurs in stretches, you'll have five missions working fine online, but then you're getting errors for the rest of the night.\n\n[Fixed, hasn't happened in a stretch of four days] [[Hasn't happened since]] Crash to desktop errors randomly.  This depends on your system, I get them, my wife doesn't.  Generally happens every 2-3 missions, and luckily mostly in town for me.\n\n[Fix is for you to login on another computer and try to load the same character, still not great]The last monster has about a 25% chance of locking you out of your character and you lose everything.  So yeah, there's that.  So if you go and buy the game, don't kill a \"Xeno'Jiiva\" if you want to keep your stuff.\n\n[Edit, lag spikes have gotten more noticeable as I get higher rank and the few seconds it takes becomes more important in dodge or die situations] [[More or less fixed, you still tend to freeze up for a split second if you get hit by an attack the knocks you out, don't know why, but it's always when you're hit and you go down.]] It is a great game, just doesn't have a great system backend.  It made my 1080 act like a portable heater until I turned it's settings down, which didn't produce any notable quality drop, thunder weapons cause frame drops, and some other performance issues.\n\n\nGame is fantastic, I can't really oversell it.  If the combat of dark souls met with world of warcraft style raiding it'd be something similiar to this.  If you do go against my advice and buy the game, remember.

There are things in the game that still retain their standard level of complexity similar to past titles, but other than that, it's a solid game that loves to be grindy in all the right ways.\n\nIf you like instant gratification and expect each monster to be a boss fight that gives you the rewards you need, walk the fuck away because this shit ain't for you. There is a lot of strategy involved for getting what you want and what you need, a lot of preparations if you want to get the really good stuff. With that in mind, the game can be played solo, and pretty damn well, but does much better with a team.\n\nDon't expect the game to get easier as you get better equipment, you're not going to be on god mode at the end of your own journey. You WILL get your ass handed to you by numerous monsters, doubly so for elder dragons. \n\n[u][b]Positives[/b][/u] \n\n[list]\n[*]Campaign isn't bad, not terribly long, but not bad.\n[*]Excellent port\n[*]Amazing visuals, monsters and landscape are all stunning to look at\n[*]Amazing sounds and effects\n[*]No Weapon is the instant meta, no weapon does everything better, every weapon does good at what you like to play as\n[*]Multiplayer is actually not as bad as it was on launch, still has hiccups though\n[*]Armors are also stunning to look at, and do function similarly to weapons in that none are the best at everything.\n[*]Plenty to do and try, the  ammount of stuff to do is quite honestly a little overwhelming at times.\n[*]Online quest search function is actually pretty well done in my opinion.\n[*]Excellent game settings and control mapping functions, tons and tons of options.

Same for the delux version.\n[*]Not so much a huge negative, but something to remember, the PC version is a few versions behind the console versions, which makes sense. \n[/list]\n\nThere's not a whole lot that I dislike at the time being, it's definitely got its grindy moments, and it takes a bit of getting used to. But overall, it's a solid game that got a rather good port and definitely is worth playing. \n\nBut like always, I'd recommend getting a spectrum of reviews to check and see if you might want to take the chance on playing it and doing a refund if you don't like it. Some of the negative reviews as of late just seem to be a bit...off to me, they are complaining about functions of the game that are well known for being the game, yet they blame it on the devs doing a bait and switch. \n\nThe game is different, it's not the Same as past monster hunter titles, but it definitely IS a monster huntert title.", "upvoted": true, "time_of_review_unix": 1539135542, "upvotes_window": 652, "total_window": 808, "percent_window": 80.6930693069307, "neu_sent": 0.667, "neg_sent": 0.114, "pos_sent": 0.219, "comp_sent": 0.9973, "neu_window": 0.6541817058096409, "neg_window": 0.08526946847960445, "pos_window": 0.2506674907292951, "comp_window": 0.3515122373300372, "percent_window_roc": 0.8299187333982063, "neu_window_roc": 0.9376655482959563, "neg_window_roc": 0.7300206407135873, "pos_window_roc": 0.7624187513621156, "comp_window_roc": 0.7836686222594005, "1day_forecast": -0.0020526442888191276, "1day_delta": -0.009757043972412394, "pos_predict": 0.030712100075207714, "neg_predict": 0.1493598202395715}, {"time_of_review": "2018-10-11T00:34:45", "review": "Shit shit shit", "upvoted": true, "time_of_review_unix": 1539218085, "upvotes_window": 662, "total_window": 823, "percent_window": 80.4374240583232, "neu_sent": 0.0, "neg_sent": 1.0, "pos_sent": 0.0, "comp_sent": -0.8957, "neu_window": 0.6551104368932033, "neg_window": 0.08648786407766987, "pos_window": 0.24869902912621336, "comp_window": 0.3478584951456317, "percent_window_roc": 0.8271941352015365, "neu_window_roc": 0.9379334257975035, "neg_window_roc": 0.7381263980813135, "pos_window_roc": 0.7597120045995636, "comp_window_roc": 0.7745321620273957, "1day_forecast": 0.009139272930281495, "1day_delta": -0.002556452486074945, "pos_predict": 0.04111272406013723, "neg_predict": 0.1397623422562399}, {"time_of_review": "2018-10-12T00:38:11", "review": "I won't talk about gameplay (which I enjoy) as there are other reviews/videos for that.\n\nBad part is that the game >still< has DENUVO Anti-Consumer Technology which provide no benefits to customer (and, at this point, company) while hogging resources meaning that if you have low/mid range PC you aren't going to enjoy the game with better graphics and you have denuvo to thank for that.

I want Monster Hunter to become more popular, but not like this.\n\nFor newcomers to the series, the game is readily accessible, easy to wrap your head around, and streamlines a lot of clunky things from previous titles. But, the game also feels like a gutted example of what the series can offer as an experience. Don't get me wrong, the streamlined options are great. Environments feel more dynamic than ever, gathering materials for items is easier in some regards, more annoying in others. No doubt entry level players will have fun and never know what they're missing.\n\nHere are my gripes, however. I'll also be expanding on each one.\n\n1: No G Rank. I understand why, the game is pretty new, and it's the Equivalent of Tri for the Nintendo Wii, which also featured no G-Rank, and some cut content. However, Normal and High Rank Quests have always been something like a lengthened Tutorial. Normal gets you used to the base mechanics, High Rank introducees advanced ones, new monsters, and better armor, and then the game starts really challenging you at G Rank and beyond. There's a chance that this will be added as a DLC option some time from now, but as far as I know, it's not even planned.\n\n2: Lack of monster variety. Again, this is because it's the equivalent of Tri. New Engine, new models, new standards. There isn't a backlog of stuff that can be easily ported over, things need to be re-worked from the ground up. But, we still don't have all the content that the consoles enjoy, with a half-year lead on their release date. This also extends to the minor monsters, who are less varied than ever.\n\n3: The Event Quest system has been handled terribly this generation; Event Quests change week to week, meaning that each quest is only available for a limited time, and whether it'll come back or not is unclear at best. I cleared most of the content of the game before the first Event Quest cycle. As an SnS Main, I was excited to use the Wiggler Hat, for instance, but by the time I'd unlocked it, I'd cleared the game, moved on to a differenty weapon altogether, and finished up anything of significant interest.\n\n4: Lack of variety in weapon design. Monster Hunter is _known_ for it's widely varied and wacky weapons. Furthermore, there's often been a small variety of joke weapons, which, whilst varying in effectiveness, were often fun to use. In this game, you'll only use 2-3 weapons at most, and quite possibly stick to just onee, based on your choice of weapon class. Furthermore, the actual visual models barely change. For the majority of upgrades, your weapon will look exactly the same, with just the secondary features being tweaked based on the materials used.\n\n5: Very few end game options. There's a particularly limited selection of Elder Dragons. Kushala Daora, Teostra, Kirin, Vaal Hazak, Xeno'Jiiva, Nergigante, and Zorah Magdaros. Whilst these, for the most part, are fairly serviceable, it's a much smaller overall cast. Kushala has received some small tweaks, Teostra has been nerfed, and Kirin has gained some new moves and has been made a little bigger, seemingly. Vaal Hazak is somewhat tedious to fight, but manageablee, although god forbid you need his teeth. Nergigante is a perfectly fine Elder Dragon, once you adjust to his moves, and Xeno'Jiiva is the big bad for the end game. But Zorah Magdaros is a joke. The fight is broken into two phases. Phase one, you blast him with artillery, and get hit back a little. So, like Jhen Mohran, but less engaging. Phase two, you fly over and run around, mining and breaking 4 nodes. Once broken, the fight is finished. Congrats. Magdaros's gear sucks, and the fight is incredibly underwhelming.\n\n6: Weird Weapon Move tweaks. Most weapon movesets have been changed. some for the better, many for the worst. Greatsword has a new higher level of charge, but it's literally unusablee in anything outside of a strike on a sleeping monster, as it has something like an 8 second wind up, and has you make a slash halfway through, which changes your position. SnS has been tweaked and nerfed, performing a backstep charge no longer vaults you into the air if it'd take you up a small ledge, meaning it's less useful for mounting. Hammer's side swipe has been replaced with a head pounding combo good for stunning. It's not actually too bad, and the side swipe has been moved elsewhere, but I miss it's original place, as it was handy for it's quick deployment.\n\n7: Although practically irrelevant, as the plot has never been a strong point for this series, the player is basically relegated to a secondary position. The story revolves around The Handler, who is clumsy, vapid, entirely oblivious, lacks even basic instincts for self preservation, and has a face reminiscent of Fem Ryder from Mass Effect: Andromeda. She spends most of the time getting into trouble, and claiming credit for things she didn't do, or even actively aggravated.\n\nI have a few thousand hours of playtime across this series, reaching all the way back to MHF2. This game is pretty, but hardly the best example of how the series can be.

MHW is by far the most playable title Capcom have released, with so many quality of life upgrades that make me wonder why it wasn't always this way. If you're been hesitant to get into this series, now is the time.\n\nCombat has always been the feature in these games, but everything has been taken up a level in World. Each weapon has several new mechanics, and movement has more dynamic options available. It also now has the environments to match, with hidden shortcuts and plenty to climb and swing around on, while still feeling like an organic environment. I can confidently say that all 14 weapon types are fun in their own way, and worth trying out. You're going to be spoilt for options when it comes to playstyle.\n\nUnlike others in the series, this one has modern graphics and doesn't look like it belongs on the PS2. You'll want a beefy computer to run this on its best settings, but if you notch down a few things it will run 1080/60p smoothly on an average graphics card.\n\nIt's fair to say there's a lot of grinding in this game, but the thing is, the grinding is also the core gameplay. You get better each time. Faster, too. Soon you're an expert at taking down that particular monster or using that weapon type. It feels good to accomplish that. If you make a habit of picking items up as you go along on your quests you'll always have what you need to make items and craft equipment. The game teaches you to be resourceful.\n\nThey still have no idea how to tell a story or create interesting characters, so if you're looking for something well written, you can forget about it. I really cringed at a few scenes. This is a game where you set your own goals and write your own narrative.\n\nThey include a mostly good selection of monsters in this title, and overall they're pretty fun to fight. The models look great and their behavior is less robotic. They even have turf wars with each other. Unfortunately the line-up is not as diverse as previous titles. While I have always preferred the more toned-down designs, I wish there were less dragons and more unusual animal types like primates, arachnids, crustaceans, and leviathans found in previous titles. There's literally one water element monster and one ice element monster, but then there's a plethora of fire and blast types. It lacks balance and variety, and the result is some monsters step on eachother's feet to provide player experiences.\n\nLate game is going to feel a bit hollow, too. It doesn't have the breadth of content that other titles in the series can offer. That being said, this is a case of quality over quantity. The main campaign has been fantastic to play, and I still far prefer this new gen experience over everything else I've had with older Monster Hunter titles.\n\nIs this for you?

brilliant, the graphics are stunning (minus some bugs like blurry low res armors that i don't know why Capcom has not patched yet)\n\nso far I have compiled some of my thoughts into this list\n\nThe good:\n\nFinally a proper Monster Hunter game on PC and next gen consoles\nVery fluid gameplay thanks to new mechanics and next gen engine\nBeautifully crafted maps, they feel alive and immersive and some monster actions can influenciate the map\nYou can play free expeditions with no time/faint limit and do whatever you want, hunt or gather resources with no rush\nNew additional weapon moves for each class\nNew armor and weapon crafting system, kinda similar to MHXX\nCharacters can use items while moving\nDamage points show up when you hit a monster (Great to spot weak points if you don't know the monster and also can be turned off)\nOnline bugs seem to be all fixed since I didn't get any trouble connecting yet\n\nThe \"bad\":\n\nWeapon design is bad, previous Monster Hunter titles had great weapon design, really flashy and really showing what monster or items you used to craft them, the idea of having a base weapon that slowly evolves into the final form is a great idea but most of the weapons design are lazy and really bland, some literally just change color a bit and that's all you get\n\nStory is average, is not bad at all, but is not a story ridden game, if you are new don't expect anything ground breaking\n\nThe monster design gave me mixed feelings, there are some great and amazing designs but there are also quite generic and bland ones, but since this game is aimed to the be a big hit on the west (and it succeeded) I think is an understandable decision by capcom design team to make more appealing designs for the western audience.\n\nThe ugly:\n\nOptimization is terrible, I get 45-50 FPS on average, some 15 FPS drops if there's a lot going on (GTX 1080 Zen 1700 16GB 4k res max settings) other games like GTA V, Ark, Forza Horizon 4 etc run at solid 60 FPS on average with same settings\n\nThere's no G rank, I'm not sure if it will be added via DLC since this is a next gen game and big downloable DLC and expansions are perfectly possible or if capcom will do the classic launching Monster Hunter World Ultimate (or something like that) after a year as a new game with full price (I really hope this isn't the case since Capcom really put a lot into this game and doing that would be just a dumb decision) \n\nOnly 4 maps (not counting arenas and boss fight zone) I understand these maps are huge and need a lot of work but Monster Hunter XX/Gen Ultimate has 27 in total, I really hope more are added in the future because as beautiful as they are once you memorize all the maps they start getting repetitive\n\nGeneral lack of content, again I will compare to Monster Hunter XX/Gen Ultimate since is the lastest release beside World, XX/Gen U has a total of 91 large monsters vs 31 large monsters on World, DLC are coming in REALLY slow and they don't bring a lot of content, it's been months since console release already got all the DLC content, PC still didn't get any and consoles have been starving since no new monsters are coming, I understand coding all of that should be really hard and this is their first shot at big release on PC/Next gen, but come on, they could just add Gold and Silver rath by copy paste the already present assets and changing skins some attacks and stats, same with monoblos and white monoblos, a copy paste of existing diablos with a new model, stats and maybe couple new attacks and you got a new (old) monster in the game to motivate the community\n\n\nTL;DR: this game is a good bang for your money, do I recommend it? Yes, absolutely, new to the series or veteran I think everyone should try this game, is it a perfect game? Sadly no, almost, only time will tell since it would be logical from Capcom to keep updating with content, patches and keeping alive this game for years to come.", "upvoted": true, "time_of_review_unix": 1540513620, "upvotes_window": 202, "total_window": 244, "percent_window": 82.78688524590164, "neu_sent": 0.78, "neg_sent": 0.099, "pos_sent": 0.12, "comp_sent": 0.965, "neu_window": 0.6695306122448982, "neg_window": 0.07950204081632652, "pos_window": 0.24281224489795913, "comp_window": 0.32670653061224453, "percent_window_roc": 0.8246265278406519, "neu_window_roc": 0.9737609329446064, "neg_window_roc": 0.6476125842260895, "pos_window_roc": 0.7014035762353393, "comp_window_roc": 0.698680559837228, "1day_forecast": 0.0033547762329666497, "1day_delta": 0.007556352459016424, "pos_predict": 0.0390261525140308, "neg_predict": 0.2236983574148308}, {"time_of_review": "2018-10-27T00:02:20", "review": "Decently fun game.

Monster hunter games always put you through some mundane tutorial stuff for the first few missions, then turn you loose into the actual game, which is amazingly fun (and addicting). Monster hunter is a bit niche, but notice how the game's ratings are climbing quite quickly on steam as time goes on. Humans love Monster Hunter. It just takes a bit of time to get there.", "upvoted": true, "time_of_review_unix": 1540857933, "upvotes_window": 176, "total_window": 217, "percent_window": 81.10599078341014, "neu_sent": 0.793, "neg_sent": 0.065, "pos_sent": 0.141, "comp_sent": 0.9324, "neu_window": 0.6480779816513763, "neg_window": 0.08984862385321105, "pos_window": 0.2528899082568808, "comp_window": 0.3634215596330274, "percent_window_roc": 0.8378277355771426, "neu_window_roc": 0.943643512450852, "neg_window_roc": 0.6873869554795267, "pos_window_roc": 0.7460456616494006, "comp_window_roc": 0.7173563568835057, "1day_forecast": -0.024393241167434798, "1day_delta": -0.022273425499231947, "pos_predict": 0.1200332618678611, "neg_predict": 0.23033877245521583}, {"time_of_review": "2018-10-31T00:22:23", "review": "good game, play fun with friend", "upvoted": true, "time_of_review_unix": 1540945343, "upvotes_window": 178, "total_window": 224, "percent_window": 79.46428571428571, "neu_sent": 0.145, "neg_sent": 0.0, "pos_sent": 0.855, "comp_sent": 0.8957, "neu_window": 0.6599333333333336, "neg_window": 0.09274222222222221, "pos_window": 0.23842222222222215, "comp_window": 0.3480288888888887, "percent_window_roc": 0.8344368995523365, "neu_window_roc": 0.9396825396825398, "neg_window_roc": 0.7051781472684086, "pos_window_roc": 0.750112157918349, "comp_window_roc": 0.7232158442430345, "1day_forecast": -0.0024350649350648457, "1day_delta": -0.017283748361730078, "pos_predict": 0.08125495696545239, "neg_predict": 0.25766404974939106}, {"time_of_review": "2018-11-01T00:27:09", "review": "Been playing Monster Hunter since Freedom 2. Gotta say mechanically speaking this is the best and smoothest Monster Hunter. This is also the most beginner friendly Monster Hunter as the learning curve isn't as steep as previous titles and the game cuts the crap and throws you straight into the action!\n\nThe Good:\n+Visually beautiful. Finally we aren't staring at small screens with low poly visuals anymore.\n+Some of the music is quite memorable.\n+Armor designs look awesome.\n+Character creator is quite stellar.\n+Monsters look, feel and move as if they were alive.\n+Gameplay controls of movement and combat are tight, much more responsive than previous titles.\n+Weapons have new movesets or have been reworked and feel so much better now!\n+Level design of each map is amazing. Areas are seamless and have multiple elevations. They are also packed with ecology and wildlife. The maps feel alive. Big props especially to the Ancient Forest cause that map really gives off them Jurassic Park vibes. Even after over 200 hours I still get lost in that map.\n+Many quality of life changes making gaming experience smoother.\n+UI is actually quite nice in this instalment.\n+Tonnes of replay value.\n+Many armor and weapons to collect to create builds that fit your playstyle: Play how you want basically.\n+RNG for monster parts is generous as you can meld rare drops such as plates and gems if you're unlucky.\n+The grind is fun. It's not the tedious mmo type of grind, but the \"hard work pays off\" type of grind.\n+Palicos themselves have quite a few options for customization including weapons, armor and skills.\n\nThe Bad:\n-Online was broken at launch (however it's fixed now).\n-Unintuitive online solution (If you're just starting you'll have to wait for your friend to finish watching the story cutscene before you can actually join their game).\n-Much less content compared to previous instalments. The amount of monsters is poor compared to Freedom Unite. There is also a severe lack of monster variety as most monsters in World are reptiles whereas previous games had giant bugs such as Seltas, Vespoid Queen, Nerscylla or apes such as Congalala, Rajang or crabs like Daimyo and Shogun Cenataurs and the list goes on.\n-Weapon designs need a serious overhaul. Most weapons look boring and the same design-wise and only change a few times within the weapon tree.\n-Decoration RNG is pain and Hero and Warrior stone drop rates are too low.\n-Some lategame monsters are super cheap with their roars or tremors where they will get a free cheap shot at you since they will finish their roar/tremor attack before your recovery animation finishes forcing you to spec at least a few slots in Tremor resist or Earplugs.\n-Story; if you're a gamer who plays games for the story, then Monster Hunter is not for you.\n\nConclusion:\nIf you like methodical combat and a gameplay loop of grinding and earning better equipment on the go while learning the monster and culling it faster next run, then this game is for you. There is tonnes of content and it's definitely bang for your buck.", "upvoted": true, "time_of_review_unix": 1541032029, "upvotes_window": 183, "total_window": 231, "percent_window": 79.22077922077922, "neu_sent": 0.743, "neg_sent": 0.108, "pos_sent": 0.149, "comp_sent": 0.9634, "neu_window": 0.6477327586206895, "neg_window": 0.08957758620689651, "pos_window": 0.25404741379310336, "comp_window": 0.3612387931034481, "percent_window_roc": 0.8312506829428201, "neu_window_roc": 0.9298029556650247, "neg_window_roc": 0.7218957326562372, "pos_window_roc": 0.7539332621710678, "comp_window_roc": 0.7378307636212106, "1day_forecast": -0.011617074908214176, "1day_delta": -0.0033477633477633217, "pos_predict": 0.11718331917011948, "neg_predict": 0.21919178737656325}, {"time_of_review": "2018-11-02T00:36:26", "review": "You can tell the game was made for a controller but once you figure out all the keyboard and mouse settings, it's a masterpiece.", "upvoted": true, "time_of_review_unix": 1541118986, "upvotes_window": 186, "total_window": 237, "percent_window": 78.48101265822784, "neu_sent": 0.788, "neg_sent": 0.0, "pos_sent": 0.212, "comp_sent": 0.7684, "neu_window": 0.6488571428571431, "neg_window": 0.08932352941176468, "pos_window": 0.2492016806722689, "comp_window": 0.3539613445378151, "percent_window_roc": 0.823156605331132, "neu_window_roc": 0.9303721488595439, "neg_window_roc": 0.7407333479710174, "pos_window_roc": 0.7607134374611217, "comp_window_roc": 0.7458681357739471, "1day_forecast": -0.02760848049174347, "1day_delta": -0.008293321693583655, "pos_predict": 0.10564276027879252, "neg_predict": 0.19585570555230175}, {"time_of_review": "2018-11-03T00:59:58", "review": "Error Code\n5038F-MW1\n50382-MW1\n50352-MW1\n\nget used to seeing these or you might lose your sanity trying to join and play any multiplayer session.

This game is pretty awesome! Why do I like it?\nWell Monsters are still amazing to fight! \nWeapons and upgrades are great! Although I wish they looked cooler.\nI am also playing past the first map and man was I wrong about how the enviroment is.\nIt really takes you in and makes you forget your actually playing a game instead of being in the jungle map or dessert map. \nTook me some time to get into it but now that I learned a few things and am acustomed to my weapons and how to fight, its a pretty amazing game.\n\nOld Review: 2 hours Into it \nI am currently 2 hours into this game. \nI was curious because of how cool it looks.\nNow I have only done the first few missions, but like every game there is ALOT you need to learn .\nAlso in this game I personally feel the time go by. Comparing it to something like witcher 3 were your immersed with its beauty of nature and Overwatch for its rather fast fun gameplay.  How I have to run everywhere and also fights are long. \nAgain I'm only 2 hours into it, but I do like how the monsters feel. \nThere huge and scary! Reminds me of when I watched Jurassic Park as a Kid and saw T-Rex.\nThe WEAPONS are awesome aswell! Many to choose from with different playstyles and cool moves. \nI also have a few problems with graphics; for example sometimes my frames slow down (minor but my pc can handle it).\nMost of the time textures take some time to load and it is very noticable. Also I had to lower the brightness quite a bit because the in game enviroment is VERY BRIGHT. \nMy Specs:\nAMD Ryzen 5 1600 \nNvidia 1060x \nAnd trust me on the rest. My PC can handle it. Ask me if you need it though I'm too lazy to look right now.\nIf I were to rate this game so far..... I'd say 7/10, if im optmistic. It may take some time to grow on me. And currently I can't\nsay I'm satisfyed with paying $60 for this game. Reminds me a lot of Evolve,  that other monster hunter game. \nO how did I forget. THE LIP SYNC WITH VOICE IS HORRENDOUS.

Think gear grind like in Diablo, but instead of random stats and items, you hunt specific monsters to craft gear from their corpses. The RNG can be a little extreme, but as long as you aren't massively impatient, just take your time and enjoy the game.

Each weapon feels completely unique, viable, powerful, and completely changes how you play the game.\n\n9/10 \n\nThe only complaints frankly is the lack of truely diverse monsters to fight that you would see in previous iterations of the MH series, and playing through with a friend can be a little irritating because of the initial join condition on story missions.

I've pretty much played all of the releases with the exception of missing one or two. This is by far my favorite one from capcom because they finally had the advantage of a powerful console to really improve the mechanics for the game. I hope they keep going in this direction with the game.\n\nI get why a lot of people are turned off from this game right away. The orginial game was built with clunky controls that made the game have a steep learning curve. But that was the fun to me and probably every other monster hunter fan. You loved the challenge of memorizing monster attacks and when to use an item (and go through the totally unneccesary flex pose leaving your self vulnerable). You worked around the clunky controls (which didnt seem so clunky after you mastered them) and felt the satisfaction of killing giant ass cool looking monsters with unique move sets. The entire series has pretty much followed the orginal game mechanics which is totally fine for me. I like the challenge because I enjoy fighting giant monsters more then getting upset about the controls and this game series is one of the few that feature killing giant monsters with cool weapons.\n\nSo the actual bad stuff I would say is:\n-Yes the cutscenes don't match the voices (who the hell cares, the games about killing giant monsters)\n-The story is kinda batshit crazy (Veteran hunter leader knows elder dragons cant be captured...........tries to capture huge ass elder dragon)\n-Everytime the handler speaks or does anything, I want to impale myself with a gunlance and pull the trigger....\n-There isnt much to do besides kill monsters and get better gear to kill more monsters (That part doesnt bother me, im just putting here because most people dont like that about the game.\n\n\nAll in all I love this game series and I love the latest direction they went with the game. I hope in time people will come to look past the one or two things wrong with the game and enjoy the game for what it is..

With reaching the global audience in mind, Capcom made numerous decisions that appeals to the Western market by streamlining some mechanics in the previous games, along with updated graphics. While it has no doubt drew more audience towards it, it also annoyed many long-time fans who thought the change was too much. I am not going to cover all of those, as readers can easily find those information online.\n\nIn this game, you play as a hunter, and your job is to aid the research of all kinds of monsters in this world by killing it or capturing it alive. The story involves you and your fellow hunters in going to an uncharted landmass and study the mysterious phenomon happening over there. Story is pretty simple. It is just there to give you a reason to be there, and serves as a tutorial for the players. Once the story is over, you are left on your own device to continue your research in this world, or move on to a different game if you think you are finished.\n\nWhen it comes to combat, I hear a lot of people compare it with the Souls games, and I think this is the sad reality of Souls coming to PC earlier than Monster Hunters. Personally, I do not think they are alike, since the focus is different. Souls is about you overcoming one obstacle after anotherby progressing through the world that is very hostile to you. This is not the case for Monster Hunter World, since there are many collectibles and traps on the map that you can utilize to tip the battle to your favor. Also it is usually monsters that would be the one running away instead of you. The combat is very action-packed, but you are not at such a disadvantaged position like you would be in a Souls game.\n\nGraphic is good enough to me. I think it does a pretty good job in presenting different parts of the world, and I like what I see.\n\nContent wise, I think it is enough for me. I understand there are people who are used to Monster Hunter games with almost 100 monsters, do bear in mind that the first game and the third game also started with a similar roster because of them being on a new platform. I am getting hundreds of hours from this game already, and I am content. Do I want more stuff? Absolutely.\n\nIs the game worth it, then? I would say yes.

While it offers a few twists on the familiar MonHun formula, MHW is very much the classic experience but beefed up for current generation consoles and the PC market.\n\nFor those looking to expand on their existing Monster Hunting experience, this game might feel a bit barren, especially compared to the most recent Ultimate and Generations titles released on handheld and console, however for new entrants to the franchise, this is very much the perfect place to start, offering a good variety of monsters and weapons to hone your hunting skills.\n\nAll in all, MHW provides a stable and amazingly nice to look at platform for both it's current and future content and most fans of third-person action will have little to complain about with the depth and breadth of activities on offer here.\n\nAverage Game Length? Milage may very hugely here especially given the random nature of certain drops, a staple of the series. A singular hunt can take anywhere from a few minutes to nearly an hour whereas completing the story of the game will likely take most players around the 30 or more hour mark if you aren't speedrunning.\n\nA Bit Like? Monster Hunter! More seriously this game really birthed it's own genre, but for similar titles try God Eater and Dauntless.\n\nIs It Fun? Absolutely. Battling huge monsters is a blast with or without friends, exploring the amazing environments, the satisfaction of finding that one loot drop and time-limited challenge expeditions all add together to give a hell of a lot of entertainment.\n\nWorth The Price? MHW does carry a full fat price tag of around \u00a350 when not on sale and while it would be hard not to reccomend for the amount of time you can get out of it, it's worth bearing in mind that other similar titles can be cheaper if you're unsure of the genre, but rest assured this is a complete expereince with more content being added at a steady clip with no additional costs for new monsters or hunts.", "upvoted": true, "time_of_review_unix": 1543363431, "upvotes_window": 7394, "total_window": 7542, "percent_window": 98.03765579421903, "neu_sent": 0.763, "neg_sent": 0.086, "pos_sent": 0.151, "comp_sent": 0.9822, "neu_window": 0.6139725573379282, "neg_window": 0.05510658889036188, "pos_window": 0.32667559326527945, "comp_window": 0.47360310221397023, "percent_window_roc": 0.9874996451610134, "neu_window_roc": 0.8852105073767542, "neg_window_roc": 0.5211942424793023, "pos_window_roc": 0.9710785128029534, "comp_window_roc": 0.9704954434454947, "1day_forecast": -0.0012646903884228067, "1day_delta": -0.0005187146836638235, "pos_predict": 0.0006828886646306981, "neg_predict": 0.07317117075166067}, {"time_of_review": "2018-11-29T00:02:08", "review": "Contstantly kept crashing, went through multiple fixes, none of witch worked.

Its chunky, blocky movements cant even be saved by the use of a controller, theres no real comfort for anyone new getting into the game. I dont recommend buying this game new unless you have played previous games of the same title. The only thing cool was picking out what your cat looks like, everything else is a total chore, no entertainment at all. You end up spending more time  preparing for a hunt and waiting for other players, it gets very boring very fast. I called it quits after the third hunt, i made several attempts, only to have the game crash, or to be killed so much id need to restart over and over again.

The open world aspect of each map seemed like both a dream and curse as I explored new, rich environments and quickly learnt that the vastness could be my downfall in a fight. Although the new maps and world as a whole are a challenging change in mechanics and strategy, the beauty of a small enclosed beach or a view over a vast, lush forest can leave you lost for words during a difficult hunt.\n\nThe veriety in weapons hasn't changed since the last title, however the way that weapons are presented has changed considerably. Each weapon being in your box from the start like in every start to a MH Game, but the practice area allows for in depth training that can make a world of difference when learning a new weapons style. As this is a new world, that also means new monsters, which will also lead to a new array of weapon and armor match ups, all of which in the later game can be mixed to boost specififc stats and allow you to hunt to your full potential.\n\nThe multiplayer is also heavily sold for hunts in both the story and in the Gathering hub for more advanced hunters, allowing you to team up with friends or just friendly hunters to get through a hunt with ease. This doesn't however limit the solo experience, as the difficulty level will increase with every added hunter, leaving no solo hunter at a disadvantage to a monster should they choose to go it alone.\n\nIn conclusion Monster Hunter: World is a sensational step forward for the franchise, showing advanced graphics on both console and PC, and a system that can be sustained through teams or solo artists to achieve the very best results in a hunt. The game is gripping from A-Z and although there can be some slow slopes to the story during investigation sections, these all link to a greater mission that will prove to be a challenge to any capable hunter.\n\n10/10 would put far too much of my free time into this game again.", "upvoted": true, "time_of_review_unix": 1545609918, "upvotes_window": 384, "total_window": 480, "percent_window": 80.0, "neu_sent": 0.8, "neg_sent": 0.075, "pos_sent": 0.126, "comp_sent": 0.9761, "neu_window": 0.6618004158004156, "neg_window": 0.09236798336798346, "pos_window": 0.2437629937629937, "comp_window": 0.35584116424116446, "percent_window_roc": 0.829449360911561, "neu_window_roc": 0.9593109593109593, "neg_window_roc": 0.7330334171189278, "pos_window_roc": 0.7272869722398659, "comp_window_roc": 0.7732631539278065, "1day_forecast": -0.014689265536723228, "1day_delta": -0.007058823529411673, "pos_predict": 0.028273869403297926, "neg_predict": 0.19485593530851267}, {"time_of_review": "2018-12-25T00:01:26", "review": "I got this game to play alongside my girlfriend, only to find out that we have to go through the mission and watch all the cutscenes, leave, and THEN we can do the mission together. it makes absolutely no sense.

A huge variety of weapons that have very differnent playstyles. Tons of awesome armor. Cool monster deisgns with satisfying boss fights. The open world areas are really cool. Very high skill ceiling that is satisfying to improve. Really deep builds/customization. A lot of fun in multiplayer.\n\nThe bad: The interface is a complete trainwreck. The multiplayer system is needlessly difficult to use and actively discourages co-op with randoms due to a single person being able to cause a complete mission failure. Multiplayer health monster scaling is bad (same health for 2 players or 4 players). A certain monster has hundreds of potential weapons, another (much cooler one) has only a single weapon. The endgame RNG grind for decorations and augments has insultingly low drop rates to keep you farming. Visual variety on weapons is pretty poor. A lot of monsters are basically reskins of existing monsters, with low monster count overall. Tons of pointless busywork in menus and farming/crafting items between hunts.

Story is alright but nothing too fancy just like the other games. I play on a prebuilt crap ACER desktop with a 1060 and get very good game play. Anyway here are my thoughts:\n\n[Pro]\n- Good Graphics and animation\n- Balanced in a way so even if you don't have friends MOST quests are solo-able.\n- Lots of even quest to gather good weapons, armour, and items. As a Great Sword user, with the proper augmentation and gems, the Wyvern Ignition Impact which is obtainable thorugh a event quest is very very good.\n- No pay to win\n- Fulfilling when you beat a elder dragon for the first time\n- Very interactive field. \n- No cancerous online players who chat crap or talk crap about you\n\n[Cons]\n- Some quests are definately harder to solo. (Eg, Kulve Taroth, Behemoth, etc)\n- Shop seems kinda lacking so I use a mod that allows me to buy great potions and flash pods which are otherwise a pain in the ass to make if you want to do a lot of quests in a quick succession\n- Great Sword designs are mostly all the same \n- Some weapons types are better than others imo\n- Not beginner friendly at all. I played MH before so I knew basic stuff but if you're a beginner, you might have a difficult time figuring things out. One thing that is very annoying is weapon combos, The practice range doesn't show you all the combos so you're better off watching a YT video.\n- Once you beat everything, it's kinda like, what now? (Guess this can go with all games) I help my friends out tho.\n- Have to watch all cutscene before someone or you friend can join or reply to your SOS call during quest,\n- Sometimes Glitchy. When I play with my friend, whenever one of us dies, our screen freezes for a short time.\n- Some times, monsters are a bit glitchy but it rarely is a problem.\n- Hate pink rathian's running around move where she constantly knocks you down repeatedly\n\nOtherthan that, its an all right game overall. Will 10/10 buy Icebourne when it comes out even thought I can kinda guess what monsters will come out XD.", "upvoted": true, "time_of_review_unix": 1548201663, "upvotes_window": 355, "total_window": 428, "percent_window": 82.94392523364486, "neu_sent": 0.658, "neg_sent": 0.127, "pos_sent": 0.215, "comp_sent": 0.9927, "neu_window": 0.6474079254079257, "neg_window": 0.08689044289044281, "pos_window": 0.2633752913752916, "comp_window": 0.4101039627039626, "percent_window_roc": 0.8396061460796636, "neu_window_roc": 0.9357309357309358, "neg_window_roc": 0.7602445060877364, "pos_window_roc": 0.7725249178815801, "comp_window_roc": 0.78817456460961, "1day_forecast": 0.01584376653147601, "1day_delta": 0.007070831283817025, "pos_predict": 0.1194217573518298, "neg_predict": 0.09509759456449801}], "data-a100fa93d4ee4f0a7f36dc3910945395": [{"time_of_review": "2018-08-16T15:33:17", "percent_window": 68.14736842105263, "review": "Good game, but the graphics are not that good.. imagine Horizon Zero Dawn as Monster Hunter World.. that would be great", "pos_sent": 0.286, "neg_sent": 0.0, "review_example": "Disappointed!", "topics": ["error", "server", "connection", "disconnect"]}, {"time_of_review": "2018-08-17T00:01:12", "percent_window": 67.47369611947053, "review": "F I X  N E T W O R K  E R R O R S", "pos_sent": 0.0, "neg_sent": 0.0, "review_example": "Crappy fighting mechanics", "topics": ["error", "server", "connection", "disconnect"]}, {"time_of_review": "2018-08-18T00:00:11", "percent_window": 65.28350515463917, "review": "EDIT 1: \n\nI don't get it why people complain about crashes, 40 hours in and I had 0 crashes during any point of the game, or any problem with the save file after the final boss,perhaps it would be a good idea to check your PC or related drivers.\n\nOr people not getting to 60FPS on high end systems, i7 6700hq and gtx 1070 and mostly 60FPS ( ultra settings with volumetric fog at low ) or few dips to low 50s when 3 monsters engage in a treesome ( rare thing tho ) .\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs someone who never played MH before I fell in love with this game from the first hour in.\n\nI don't get why people are saying it is a bad PC port:\n- Sure there's the multiplayer network problems but hopefully we will get that fixed soon.\n\n- Runs well on my laptop i7 6700hq/gtx1070, constant 60FPS with a few dips into low 50s,\n Ultra settings and volumetric fog at low /w Xbox1 controller.\n\n- My CPU usage is in the 50-75% range and GPU is about 80-90% usage, to mention that I \n capped my frames at 60 for that gsync treat.\n\n- But yeah in 15 or so hours of playing I didn't encounter any crashes or bugs.\n\n- As for people that complain about mouse control, you are all abosolute madmen, do \n  yourself a favor and go grab a controller, it's like cheaper than the game.\n\n- Tip for Nvidia users, don't get the new driver for MHW ( aka Version 398.82 ) , it will make your game run bad,wait for them to fix it and meanwhile use any previous driver.

Technical issues riddle through it and that is a huge issue. Preformance for me specifically is fine and I pretty much have the recommended specs on all highest so that's something. I hear and have seen a lot of others getting hit by dips in fps and cpus running up to 100% for seemingly no reason. I mean this game is pretty but its basically a console texture job so the preformance is completely unwarranted. \n\nMy issue, and the issue that I think is what needs to be addressed post friggin haste is the communication errors. Holy christ almighty they are rampant and they are annoying. I mean its a big game and idk how big Capcom expected this game to be or how much of an audience it expected to pull but this far after release and no patch, well let's just say it smells fishy. \n\nI will say I think this game has been getting a VERY unfair shake by some communities stemming from *cough*Reddit*cough* and the little lynch mobs they like to employ but they are entitled to their opinions but I will say that KB+M is fine with some tweaking. I found the ranged controls unsavory but not 40% positive reviews unsavory. The preformance is an issue absolutely but again not warranted of the collapsing public opinion this game is experiencing. However I get the sentiment for a $60 game you want things done right. Controller is fine, I genuinely don't understand why people are throwing fit after fit becasue of it unless they are using some obscure pad. xbox controllers are adequate if not good. \n\nThe heart of this game's issue, if I had to guess, is Denuvo. I loathe Denuvo, which isn't an unshared opinion. I am willing to place a lot of the technical issues this game is experiencing at Denuvo's feet and I wouldn't be surprised if that comes out later and Capcom does nothing. \n\nI recommend the game but under conditions. This game just does better, in my experience, in single player. I get it, its not the traditional MonHun experience to play alone all day but if its what you were going for anyways then you are in a good place. Another condition is this: If it does come out that Denuvo is the cause of 1080 ti's running sub 60 fps, or the cause of massive CPU usage spike, constant data leaks or those god forsaken communication errors, if that comes out and Capcom does not respond accordingly: Do not buy this game.

Think gear grind like in Diablo, but instead of random stats and items, you hunt specific monsters to craft gear from their corpses. The RNG can be a little extreme, but as long as you aren't massively impatient, just take your time and enjoy the game.

I've pretty much played all of the releases with the exception of missing one or two. This is by far my favorite one from capcom because they finally had the advantage of a powerful console to really improve the mechanics for the game. I hope they keep going in this direction with the game.\n\nI get why a lot of people are turned off from this game right away. The orginial game was built with clunky controls that made the game have a steep learning curve. But that was the fun to me and probably every other monster hunter fan. You loved the challenge of memorizing monster attacks and when to use an item (and go through the totally unneccesary flex pose leaving your self vulnerable). You worked around the clunky controls (which didnt seem so clunky after you mastered them) and felt the satisfaction of killing giant ass cool looking monsters with unique move sets. The entire series has pretty much followed the orginal game mechanics which is totally fine for me. I like the challenge because I enjoy fighting giant monsters more then getting upset about the controls and this game series is one of the few that feature killing giant monsters with cool weapons.\n\nSo the actual bad stuff I would say is:\n-Yes the cutscenes don't match the voices (who the hell cares, the games about killing giant monsters)\n-The story is kinda batshit crazy (Veteran hunter leader knows elder dragons cant be captured...........tries to capture huge ass elder dragon)\n-Everytime the handler speaks or does anything, I want to impale myself with a gunlance and pull the trigger....\n-There isnt much to do besides kill monsters and get better gear to kill more monsters (That part doesnt bother me, im just putting here because most people dont like that about the game.\n\n\nAll in all I love this game series and I love the latest direction they went with the game.

Maybe all of that comes from other Monster Hunter games, but as I said, I'm no expert. \n\nI can talk a ton about the game forever, but my honest opinion is just for you to try it yourself. Grab a group of friends and go explore what this world has to offer! \n\nDon't bash the game because it doesn't have this or that from the other games. They chose to take certain things out and implement other new things. This doesn't make the game \"bad\" it makes it different. If you've played 4 hours of the game with a great sword and comment \"this game sucks\" you suck. You didn't even try! Sink 40 hours in this bad boy and tell me it's unplayable trash. \n\nScoutflies are bad sometimes. Learn the map and you won't need them as much. \n\nGreat game, recommend it for anyone who loves co-op games and doesn't mind some grinding. I will be completing this game no matter how long it takes and I'm sure I'm not alone on this. \n", "pos_sent": 0.168, "neg_sent": 0.098, "review_example": "Amazing game <3", "topics": ["friends", "monster", "recommend"]}, {"time_of_review": "2018-08-28T00:02:14", "percent_window": 73.96166134185303, "review": "With the connection issues mostly resolved, this game is absolutely my current Game of the year.

Every year, hopeful that a new version would be released on the newer generation of playstation consoles. I even had hoped it might move over to xbox just so I could get my fix. The hope never left me.\n\nNow! It is here! In all it's graphical beauty. I may have moved on to the PC stage and am happy to do so. I am in awe. I was truly blown away during what I believed was a cutscene, but was amazed when I was viewing my player with all his detail and equipment during the movies. As I changed gear and new cutscenes emerged, so too would my characters image during the playback. What a time. \n\nIf you're in for a grindfest, repeatedly killing monsters that are akin to Lightning Unicorns or Firebreathing Dragons or perhaps a Water Snake with constant evolving/devolving legs with different difficulties or maybe you'd like to try your hand at a Bomb-dropping Armadillo, then this is the game for you. \n\nNeed the gear to be better equiped at the monster you're killing? You'll have to kill that monster multiple times. It's satisfying when you clearing a quest and have achieved victory. \n\nThere are multiple weapons to use based on your preference with different attributes that you can craft as you farm the monsters you battle. You can craft gear based on the monsters as well (although you'll have to defeat them several times for the pieces you need). Then there are charms. A single item you can bring with you that gives you another boost to a skill, based on the amount you have upgraded it. Then, there is jewelry. Certain weapons/armor have slots you can place these jewels for another boost. The possibilities are endless.\n\nThe community has been great. It's very easy to drop in and out of parties and everyone is, generally, very welcoming.\n\nThe farming never stops and you'll get well worth what you've paid for.
